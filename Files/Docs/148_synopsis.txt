Tiffany tells Robert that Rebekah is a Kwan, that she has a Kwan baby boy and her husband died a few months ago. She talks about how they're so much alike. Robert, however is now suspicious. He thinks back to the Kwans attacking them on the ship. He wonders how they knew they were going to land there and also, how was Lemor-Ixa able to hijack the box's controls? He suspects that maybe Rebekah isn't as trustworthy as she's letting on. He doesn't want to tell Tiffany this because she seems more at peace and happier than she has ever since she's arrived and he doesn't want to ruin that for her. Besides, he doesn't have any evidence but he's going to privately keep an eye on Rebekah.
