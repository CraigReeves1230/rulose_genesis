\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Smoke came by the apartment later. He and Amaga shared stories about what life was like as slaves. Seeing them together was heartwarming. They were very close, laughing and completing each other\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sentences. Their friendship reminded Robert very much of his friendship with Tiffany. During their conversation, Amaga brought up something interesting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Kwans are now starting to ramp up on slave labor. They\u8217\'92re bringing more people into their slave camps and they\u8217\'92ve built two new factories.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What for?\u8221\'94 Robert asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re building something. What, I have no idea,\u8221\'94 Amaga said. \u8220\'93All I know is that my brother and his team hacked into the Kwans\u8217\'92 workforce management database and found that their weapons and defense department laborers have been working substantially more hours than normal. That, along with the fact that they\u8217\'92re building two factories and bringing all of these new slaves in leads us to believe they\u8217\'92re building some kind of weapon.\u8221\'94}}
