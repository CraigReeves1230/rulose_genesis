\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Like Robert, Tiffany would have to report for medical checkups every day that would last four hours. She hated them just as much as Robert did if not even more because she herself was a physician and did not feel like some of the checkups were necessary.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She would also have to report to the sleep study room at bedtime. Like Robert, she was given her medication to take and the lights would go out. Unlike Robert, however, she didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sleep very well in the sleep study at all. She constantly woke up and could not go back to sleep, feeling wound up despite one of the side effects of the medication being severe drowsiness. Robert remembered feeling tired all the time but Tiffany became increasingly more and more wound up before crashing in a two hour light sleep and then waking up wound up again. They gave her sleeping pills which were somewhat helpful. Being the physician that she was, Tiffany was curious as to why the medication was having such a different effect on her sleep patterns compared to Robert.}}
