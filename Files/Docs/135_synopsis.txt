Rebekah reveals that she has a son named Skyler who is a Kwan. She reveals she is Queen Riptide's sister. Tiffany wants to know if Rebekah feels the way she said she felt about her. Rebekah said that is her default position for everyone because many people have let her down in her life, such as her sister. She says that truthfully, the more she thinks about it, Tiffany has given her no reason to believe she's "useless" and that she's sorry. Rebekah says things have been hard for her lately as her husband, a Kwan Marshal, was executed for treason a few months ago after it got out that he was with her. This seems to heal the relationship some between Rebekah and Tiffany.
