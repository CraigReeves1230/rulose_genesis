\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The next morning, Robert walked into the living room and the TV instantly came on all by itself. It was Father Quelatune.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Robert. How are you, Son?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Good, thanks,\u8221\'94 Robert answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Listen, I need you to come to the Intelligence Center for a meeting. Smoke has ordered an investigation on Tiffany\u8217\'92s death.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Robert was alarmed by this. Why would Intelligence be doing an investigation? Did they think there was foul play? He had a feeling that some in the Council would once again blame Rebekah just like they blamed her for Amaga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death. He had no reason to believe Rebekah was behind this. Tiffany was being examined by several doctors and none of them knew why she wasn\u8217\'92t responding to the medication she was being given.}}
