Robert and Smoke lead a direct invasion of the city of Amelrak in the X2 flown by Robert and Smoke, the Blue Dragons, the X1 flown by Cypher and a student named Armond as well as the A1 flown by Amaga and Leoma because they think they've ramped up on slave labor to build a weapon of some kind. Rebekah is against it as it would be dangerous, reminding them that Riptide has never lost a major battle. Cypher returns to help out. Lemor-Ixa hi-jack's Cypher's X2, Cypher's jet engine fails and crashes. He dies. It is again put over that Queen Riptide is deeply proud that she has never lost a battle.
