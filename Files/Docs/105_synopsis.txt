Quelatune takes them on a tour of the Temple to get Robert back in good spirits. They finally meet Marxis at Mission Control and they meet Amaga's brother Smoke, a master hacker and Director of Intelligence. Robert is suspicious of Rebekah and grills Smoke on her as he assumes Smoke would have dirt on her. This makes Tiffany uncomfortable. He asks how the Kwans knew they were going to be landing in the Desert of Illusion. Robert grills Smoke but he doesn't know any more and refers him to his sister Amaga.
