Interestingly enough, Robert\u8217\'92s dizziness and weakness didn\u8217\'92t really start to subside until midway through week four, so she was actually ahead of schedule in that regard.

It was possible that stress from overwork (she was still working full time as Head Counselor) was a contributing factor to that along with her sleep difficulties. The medication she was taking lowered Robert\u8217\'92s blood pressure. Father Quelatune ordered that she take time off completely and just focus on her recovery.}
