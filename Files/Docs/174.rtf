\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tiffany\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s operation was performed by the same medical staff that performed Robert\u8217\'92s. The operation was said to be a success. Robert was right there by her side when she awakened. She felt dizzy and tired the same way Robert felt when he woke up from surgery. Like Robert, she was told this would subside within a few weeks. Robert reassured her that the first couple of weeks were the toughest but that it got easier as the symptoms would begin to subside. }
