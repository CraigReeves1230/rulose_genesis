The Temple is bombed, killing hundreds. They round up more slaves. Intelligence believe that it was once again an attempt to get back the refugees. More political pressure mounts to exile them but Quelatune says no. The medical facility was bombed where Kaoli Man took place. But how did they know about it? They also ramped up on slaves because they're obviously trying to build something in Amelrak. Could be a weapon. They don't know what it is.
