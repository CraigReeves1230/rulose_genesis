            <Title>Kwans attack Candel</Title>
            <Synopsis>Two Kwan airships attack
Candel Village. Quelatune is notified and sends troops there but it's too late.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was sunset in Candel Village: a poor rural town on the coast of Rulose Island with dirt roads and satellite fixtures atop dusty, futuristic dome-like structures. Villagers dressed in hand-me-downs and coarse, hooded robes busily went about their way. A banged up carry-car, which resembles a Humvee with a large tank in the back for food storage, moved along the muddy streets as annoyed villagers moved out of the way. 
A shirtless child and his sister were playing tag in a busy alley. Little did they know that there were several people in the alley that were looking up at the sky. The sound of aircraft suddenly became audible to everyone. Several people in the alley and nearby instantly panicked and ran for cover along with the two children. What was once a tranquil scene instantly turned into utter chaos. Merchants completely knocked over their own stuff to escape as the sound of globular thrusters echoed overhead.
Two impressive looking war machines cast an ominous shadow over the village and rained down heavy missiles. These two aircraft were unlike any in the entire galaxy and far more impressive than what is available on Earth. Each one of these things were twice the size of an F-22 fighter jet and twice as lethal. Domed houses exploded and caught on fire, vehicles tipped over and running villagers were vaporized.
A deafening siren-like hum echoed from one of the aircraft. That meant it was time for phase two. The two war machines came down lower and made their descent, crushing several buildings and vehicles in the process. Kwan militants burst out of the back doors bearing heavy rifles. Kwans are extra-terrestrials that look like bald black people with cat-like eyes and pointy, elf-like ears. Screaming villagers were kidnapped and tossed inside the two aircraft. Women were snatched from their husbands, husbands from their wives, children from their parents.

The large, hi-tech War Room of the Rulose Temple was in a frenzy. Government officials moved quickly and frantically. Strategists, air-traffic controllers and military personnel rushed to their stations. Father Quelatune, President of Rulose Island: a black, elderly, bearded patriarch donning a cleric-like robe, made his way down the adjacent hallway along with a beautiful light-skinned black woman dressed in a sleek, form-fitting body-suit. This was Rebekah, the Head Counselor, the highest member of the Rulose Island Senate.
“When did it start, Rebekah?” he asked.
Rebekah glanced at her watch. “Just a few minutes ago, sir. It’s Candel Village. It’s the Kwans.”
They quickly made their way into the War Room bustling with chaos.
Quelatune asked, “Has help been sent out?”
“Just now. The Burgundy Guard’s been sent. Amaga’s leading the charge.”
Amaga is the Secretary of Defense and is the only woman in Rulose history to ever be elected for that position. She is the director of all military operations on Rulose Island. The Burgundy Guard is an elite air-military branch of Rulose Island that is first to respond to terrorist attacks. In rank, they are second only to the Blue Dragons. If there was anyone who could save Candel from certain destruction, it was them.

Two Burgundy Guard rescue crafts descended into a destroyed Candel Village. Rubble was everywhere as well as several dead bodies and survivors in shock looking for their loved ones. The normally solid domed structures and buildings of Candel were crushed like soda cans. Many of them were in flames as smoke clouded the sky. A group of heavily armed Burgundy Guard soldiers came out and surveyed the area. They were led by General Amaga: a fierce, beautiful black-skinned woman with a very short fro of hair. She took off her helmet as several panicked citizens quickly approached them, begging for help in finding their loved ones. Amaga did the best she could to comfort them.
“We’re gonna help you find your family. We promise,” she told some.
“We’re right on it,” she told others.
“Absolutely, we know this is difficult for you,” she would say to even more.
“Please don’t leave us alone out here!” a hysterical old woman pleaded while hanging onto Amaga’s arm. 
Amaga took the woman by the hand. “We promise you that nothing bad is going to happen to you. Where we are taking you will be safe.” She then pointed toward one of the rescue crafts. “You’re just gonna go on that rescue ship right over there, OK? If anything happens, we’ll take care of it.”
She and her team made their way over near one of the rescue ships as other Burgundy Guard soldiers led the old woman and a long line of others on board. Amaga regrouped with her unit.
“We were too late. Father Quelatune is not going to like this at all,” she said.
“He’s probably going to be calling you any minute now,” one of the soldiers responded.
“I’m prepared.” 
She looked out at the line of citizens continuing to board the rescue ship. She shook her head in dismay. “Lord help me.” 
Her stomach was in knots thinking about how she was going to report her failure to show up in time to Father Quelatune. She was handpicked as his Secretary of Defense for a reason and has hardly ever lost a mission, especially one of this magnitude. 
At that, the sound of the communications device mounted on her collar beeped.
“Father Quelatune, is that you?” she asked nervously.
“What’s it looking like out there?” he asked.
She looked around at all the dead bodies, destroyed property and panicked survivors boarding the rescue ships through a thick wall of smoke and convection. “We were too late, Father. I’m really sorry.”
There was silence momentarily on the other end.
“It’s my fault, Amaga. Don’t worry about it. Just make sure everyone gets home safely. We’ll bring our recovery unit over for repairs as soon as we figure up the cost of rebuilding the village.” 
Quelatune hung up.
Amaga could feel her eyes stinging but she held back the tears as not to look weak in front of the all male unit she was leading. She then refocused and made her way over to the cabin of one of the rescue ships, went inside and started making the adjustments to depart. She put on her headset.
“Attention all passengers. Please make sure to let us know if there is anyone you are looking for, any loved ones or people like that before we leave. Once we leave, we can’t come back,” she said through the rescue ship’s PA system out to the line of passengers boarding the ship.
The last person to board the ship was a father and his child. After that, the back door of the ship closed as everyone, crying and weeping, took their seats. Soldiers attempted to comfort them.
Amaga took command of the controls at the cockpit but closed her eyes first to collect herself.</Text>

            <Title>Kwan history</Title>
            <Synopsis>The Kwnans are an extra-terrestial people who invaded the planet, colonized every nation and went to war with Rulose Island but reached a cease-fire in exchange for Kaoli Emerald energy, but that cease-fire was broken after slaves from the Kwan Empire sought refuge on Rulose Island and Father Quelatune refused to deport them.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Kwans are an extra-terrestrial race from the planet Kwantar: a planet millions of miles away whose natural resources were depleted twenty years ago. This caused its people to seek out another planet to call home. They found one a decade ago which happened to be this one, invaded it, subjugated and colonized nation after nation due to their superior technology (and germs that humans weren’t immune to) and within the short span of four years, took over most all of the planet, setting up the Kwan Empire. Its ruler was Queen Riptide, a young tyrant whose barbaric ways were impugned even by many of her own people, but not in her presence lest they be killed.
There was one nation they had yet to conquer and that was Rulose Island. That is not to say they didn’t try. The Kwan Empire and Rulose Island were at war for three years but a cease-fire was agreed upon between the two nations in exchange for a natural resource that can only be found on Rulose Island: power from the Kaoli Emerald.
The Kaoli Emerald is a powerful green gem-stone the size of a school bus that is housed in a chamber of the Rulose Temple, Rulose Island’s main government building. The Kaoli Emerald is the single largest piece of pure Kaolium in the world. Kaolium is a non-metallic element that is easily able to absorb nearly infinite amounts of energy. Not only that, but energy can be extracted from it. The Kaoli Emerald was unearthed from deep under the ground roughly 25 years ago and was dated to be nearly as old as the planet itself. Because it was so deep under the ground, it was able to absorb energy for billions of years from the planet’s core, meaning that it was sufficient to power an entire planet for several million years and still have plenty left to spare. 
After the Kwans took over the rest of the world, their demanding technology, reckless abandon and lack of regard for the well-being of the planet depleted its natural resources. The general belief is that Queen Riptide attempted to conquer Rulose Island so that the Kwans could obtain control of the Kaoli Emerald and its limitless power. The only problem for them was that the Kaoli Emerald allowed the Rulose to become the most advanced nation on the planet, surpassing even the technological prowess of the Kwans. While the Kwans certainly had a numbers advantage, they did not have the technological know-how to efficiently extract power from the Kaoli Emerald, and therefore were forced to cooperate with the Rulose in a cease-fire agreement. The Rulose would extract power from the Kaoli Emerald and transfer it to ordinary coal, which would create a fossil-fuel known as Kaolite that was easy for the Kwans to burn and use. While Kaolite isn’t anywhere near as powerful as pure Kaolium energy directly from the Kaoli Emerald, the Kwans seemed fine with the compromise and were therefore willing to leave the Rulose alone. 
Tensions began to rise when human slaves from the Kwan Empire started to take refuge on Rulose Island. After stories broke out of them being abused and raped by their masters, Father Quelatune refused to deport them back to the Kwan Empire despite Queen Riptide’s constant demands for him to do so. This lead to several threats from Kwan officials that they would end the cease-fire. Father Quelatune had to deal with enormous political pressure from both sides to either deport the refugees or keep them in the country. 
Amaga happened to be one of these refugees. She and her younger brother by two years, Smoke, led the biggest slave exodus in the history of the Kwan Empire, hijacking a slave ship and safely landing the aircraft at a private airport near Candel, freeing all 150 slaves on board. They were able to go back and do this successfully again, freeing another 150. 
Several Rulatians (citizens of Rulose Island) praised Amaga and her brother’s act of bravery while many criticized them for putting the country at risk. The Kwans were furious over the exodus as they saw it as a huge embarrassment. Father Quelatune elected both Amaga and Smoke to become members of his Cabinet, which was a massively controversial move that many members of the Council disagreed with. Quelatune, however, felt that it was the right call as he not only greatly admired Smoke and Amaga, but in the case that the Kwans decided to end the cease-fire, he had two people on his team that knew the Kwan Empire inside and out. 
There was little doubt that the tensions between Rulose Island and the Kwan Empire over the slave refugees had reached its boiling point. The attack on Candel was the first military campaign by the Kwans against the Rulose since the cease-fire was put in place three years ago. Candel, for all intents and purposes, was a nothing town so the Kwans were merely sending a message: that the cease-fire between them and Rulose Island was officially over and that they were ready to go to war again. 
The Kwans were certainly going to attack major cities such as Castlerock and Midway, each with populations exceeding 4 million, next. They would then set their sights on Angelina, the capital and commercial center of Rulose Island, home to the Rulose Temple and the technological envy of the world with a population of over 9 million.</Text>

            <Title>Quelatune's mission</Title>
            <Synopsis>Quelatune decides to wage war on the Kwan Empire since they violated the peace treaty. He decides to restart Kaoli Man. They felt they got it right this time. But because Kaoli man is unpopular, they decide to keep it secret and elect someone from Earth as a guinea pig to keep it secret. Queen Riptide has never lost a battle.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Fellow Rulatians, what happened yesterday was a declaration of war,” Father Quelatune at the podium said before the two hundred member Council in the Grand Hall of the Rulose Temple, a large ornate meeting hall with beautiful pillars of cream-colored marble that reached up to the high ceiling. 
The Council is a group of elected officials who serve as the legislative branch of Rulose Island, playing a role in governing similar to the United States Congress. There are two chambers of the Council: the Senate and the House of Ambassadors. 
“The cease-fire has been broken, and unfortunately, it means that this great nation is at war once again,” he said.
Quelatune knew what was going to come up so he was already prepared.
“Many of you will blame me for this uprising, and I want you to know that you will be right. I am to blame. If I would have just deported the hundreds of thousands of refugees that have not only called Rulose Island their home, but have become productive members of society, educating our children, starting businesses, creating jobs and some of them serving in our armed forces, maybe, just maybe, Queen Riptide would have left us alone. But I’m sorry, I’m not going to do that. We all know what would have happened to those refugees had I deported them. They all would have been killed for running away, and there is still no guarantee that would have prevented the tragic events that took place in Candel from happening. We did not become the country that we became by burying our heads in the sand and willingly allowing people who became citizens to be sent back to the barbaric country they escaped from only to be tortured and killed. That is why I have decided that these people are worth going to war for.”
Despite the fact that many people in the Council had publicly expressed their disagreement with keeping the refugees, Quelatune’s speech received a huge applause. Rebekah, who was sitting behind him, smiled as she stood up and applauded along with many others.
“I realize, however, that our country, while technologically the most advanced in the world, is outnumbered. We’re up against an army that is not only well-trained, but ten times the size of ours. Queen Riptide has never lost a major battle and so we need to gain the upper hand somehow. It is for this reason that I have decided to restart the Kaoli Man project.”
At that, a wave of shock and reaction overtook the Council. Quelatune was prepared for that as well.
The Kaoli Man project was a campaign that took place prior to the cease-fire that attempted to turn Rulose soldiers into powerful sorcerers who would have the ability to call up forces from the Spirit World. A small portion of a soldier’s life energy would be surgically extracted from his body and stored into a shard of Kaolium called a Crystal. That shard of Kaolium would act as the soldier’s personal key to the Spirit World. 
Hundreds of soldiers volunteered for the project. It turned out to be one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Rulose Island and remains a huge black mark on Father Quelatune’s presidency, because something went horribly wrong and every one of the soldiers who participated in the experiment died as a result of it. 
Scientists were able find that when life energy is extracted from mammals, a genetic mutation causes the nervous system to shut down, eventually leading to death within a few weeks of the operation. A month or two after the operations were completed, soldiers began dying left and right without any explanation at the time.
Since then, an oral medication has been devised that would eliminate the genetic mutation’s effect on the nervous system behind the original project’s failure, but by then the political damage had been done and the public trust in the program was irreparable. The Kaoli Man project became so unpopular that the public would never allow it to be attempted again, even if it would be successful the second time around. The last thing the Rulose government needed at this time was a citizen revolt so for them it was better to just not take the risk. Not only that, but it wasn’t necessary because of the cease-fire. The cease-fire, however, was no longer in place so the possibility of a revised Kaoli Man project was back on the table.
“Seeing as to how unpopular the Kaoli Man project is, I know that there’s no chance the public would allow us to do it again, nor would anyone volunteer. We want to make sure that it is safe but again, no one is going to allow their loved ones who serve in our military to undergo it, and understandably so. Because of that, I have arranged for us to visit Earth and find someone there who is willing. Earth’s people are just like us. They’re humans just like we are. Therefore, we will be able to utilize our new method that we are quite sure will be successful this time on one of them without the public knowledge.”
There was more chatter amongst the council. A trip to Earth not only was expensive, but also dangerous. There was absolutely no way anyone would have known how Earth’s people would receive them. Not only that, but there was no way anyone from Earth would be willing to undergo this project knowing the risks involved. The idea was that the people of Earth wouldn’t have to know about what happened to all of those soldiers the first time. 
The biggest challenge would be finding someone from Earth willing to visit a planet he or she never even knew existed.</Text>

            <Title>Robert at Home</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert's wife comforts him after another PTSD attack. Robert is a Black Hawk Down vet.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A fresh fire in the fireplace was burning, on the television was a paused game of Super Mario All-Stars and Robert Vance was hunched over on the couch of his cozy living room shaking in panic as his wife Diane comforted him. He had just suffered another post-traumatic flashback. Ever since he has come back home to Washington, D.C. from his deployment in Mogadishu, Somalia three months ago, he has had great difficulty in sleeping and even getting basic chores done around the house. A thirty-five year old African-American United States Army helicopter pilot (CW3), he always considered himself tough and brave, but the psychological after-effects of what he went through during Operation Gothic Serpent were able to break down even the most brazen of soldiers.
During an operation in Mogadishu, his Black Hawk helicopter was shot down by an RPG from one of warlord Mohammad Farrah Aidid’s militants. He was captured afterwords. The incident is most commonly known as the Battle of Mogadishu or Black Hawk Down. Robert was eventually rescued and given a Purple Heart when he returned home, but the traumatic experience still haunted him even three months later.
“Just stay with me here,” he whispered quietly as his breathing began to slow.
“I’m right here, Bob. I’m not going anywhere. You’re doing fine.”
Diane’s been through this before and so has Robert. Robert never liked being a burden on anyone and always felt like he was when he was having a flashback. He never told Diane when he was having one and often tried to hide it when one was coming on, but she knew him too well to be fooled. Diane didn’t mind comforting him. It bothered her that he felt as if he were being a burden on her whenever she had to.
“I’m sorry, Diane,” he mumbled.
“Don’t. Please, Bob.”
He buried his head in her bosom as he began to calm down. He then sat up.
“You want some ice cream?” she asked as if speaking to a child.
Robert shook his head despite ice cream being his favorite comfort food after a flashback.
Robert got up from the couch. “I’m just gonna head out to JJ’s now.”
Caution overtook Diane’s delicate ebony face. “You really don’t need to be drinking at this time, Baby.”
“I’ll have one drink and that’s it. I’m just gonna catch up with Tiffany because she’s in town. I haven’t seen her since I’ve come back.” 
Robert went to go put on his jacket.
“Alright, Robert. Tell her I said hi. I’m gonna go ahead and start supper, OK?” 
She kissed him and headed toward the kitchen.
“Thank you. I love you,” Robert said on his way out the door.</Text>

            <Title>Robert and Tiffany</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert hangs out at the bar with Tiffany and we learn more about their backgrounds. Tiffany's husband died during Operation Gothic Serpent.</Synopsis>
            <Text>JJ’s was a dive bar near the wrong part of town but Robert knew the bartender so he liked to frequent the place. Tiffany Lawnson, a very short but beautiful and athletic brunette in her mid-thirties, was wearing a short dress so when she made her way to the bar toward Robert, there were wet whistles from  truckers, bikers and dirty old men as she walked by. 
“Made it,” she said as she sat down next to him and they exchanged hugs.
“I miss you so much, Tiff!” Robert said happily. He looked her up and down. “You look great!”
Robert and Tiffany were both in the military. She was a physician in the United States Air Force. Tiffany met Robert through her husband Maj. Randall Lawnson, who also served in the Army and was a close friend of Robert’s. Randy was tragically killed in Mogadishu. The loss was particularly devastating for both Tiffany and Robert.
“How are you holding up? We haven’t seen each other since the funeral,” Robert asked.
“One day at a time. It’s still rough. It’s only been three months.” 
She looked away momentarily, seemingly to recompose herself. 
“I’m sorry, Tiffany,” Robert said. 
She sat upright and tossed her hair back as though she were trying to cheer herself up. “Mikey misses you. You ought’a come see him. He’s getting big just like his daddy.”
Tiffany’s face never failed to light up when talking about her five month old son Michael.
“Man, I wish I had children. As you know, Diane can’t have kids. T-shaped uterus they say,” Robert said.
“You can adopt.” 
Tiffany nudged him playfully after an awkward silence. “You’re a married war hero, Bob, I’m pretty sure any adoption agency in the world could find you and Diane a child.” 
Robert took another swig of beer from his glass.
“Another?” Jay, one of the owners of the bar and longtime friend of Robert’s asked after he downed the last bit.
“Yeah, brother,” Robert said.
Tiffany looked Robert over with curiosity. “How many of those have you had?” 
“I can hold my liquor,” Robert said.
Tiffany knew where this was going.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Robert gets drunk and falls asleep on Tiffany's couch. He awakens to find out his wife was killed in a Jihadist murder/suicide.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“You tell my wife I’m this wasted I’m gonna tell all your friends you still sleep with a night light,” Robert said in slurred speech as he slumped onto Tiffany’s living room couch.
He completely lost count of how many beers he drank. Thankfully, Tiffany wasn’t a heavy drinker and was simply there to drive him home. She knew that after flashbacks, Robert would either eat so much ice cream that he would vomit or drink so much beer that he would vomit. In both cases, it was either she or Diane who would be cleaning up his vomit. 
She laid a blanket over him. “I’m pretty sure your wife is going to wonder where the hell you are. In fact, I’m surprised she hasn’t called already. How long have you been gone? It’s past midnight.” 
No answer.
Robert was passed out. She chuckled to herself as she shut the light off and walked out of the living room.

“Rise and shine, soldier,” Tiffany said as Robert slowly opened his eyes. 
She had Michael in her arms, trying to get him to burp.
Robert looked around groggily. “Where am I?” 
Tiffany rolled her eyes. “You’re in big trouble, pal.” 
She handed him his pager. “Your wife has paged you eleven times. I tried to call her back but she wouldn’t pick up.”
Robert sat up, glanced at the pager and then looked at the clock on the coffee table. “Oh my God, it’s noon. I gotta get home!” 
He quickly sat up and fumbled for his keys. 
Tiffany pulled his keys out of her pocket and tossed them to him. “I drove you home, remember?”
Robert went over to the cordless phone on the wall near the stairs. “I’ll try to call her back first.” 
“You have a really trusting wife. I’m pretty cute, Robert. You better hope she doesn’t think somethin’s goin’ on.”
That line would have worked better if her hair wasn’t all undone and she weren’t wearing sweats holding a baby.
“Whatever,” he said as he began to dial his house.
“Um, hello?” Robert asked as if surprised by the voice on the other end. Tiffany put her son back in his crib.
“Yeah, this is he. Who is this?”
Tiffany sat down on the couch next to him.
“Uh huh.”
“What!? What happened!? Is she OK!?”
Tiffany was concerned at this point.
“What!!? N, n, no!! Wh, what!!!?” he screamed.
Tiffany, stricken with fear of the unknown was about to say something but the words would not come out.
“Oh my God. Oh my God.”
Robert dropped the phone on the floor and cried. Tiffany instinctively comforted him. 
“Bob!” she cried out as she hung up the phone. “What happened, Bob?”
“Last night,” he said through sobs. “Last night, at my house there was a break-in.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Tragedy has striken Robert</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert was shaking as was Tiffany. Once he told her what had gone down it hit her almost as hard as it hit him. It turns out that someone looking for him broke into his house and murdered his wife. The killer was identified as an SNA (Somali National Alliance) sympathizer who took his own life afterwords.
“Bob, I can drive you to your house,” Tiffany said quietly.
“I don’t even know how I’m gonna react seeing all those police cars.”
She took him by the hand. “Stay here as long as you want. I mean that, OK?”
He nodded and collected himself momentarily, rising to his feet. “Let’s go.” 
They headed out the door. Tiffany followed.

They pulled up to his house and were met with exactly what Robert feared he would be met with. Police tape lined the premises and there were a number of police cars outside. Right when he and Tiffany stepped out of her car, he couldn’t contain himself. He stared in horror and was transfixed. A cop came over to the two of them.
“Mr. Vance,” the officer said solemnly.
Robert heard nothing and continued to stare at his house.
Tiffany knew what was going to happen next. “Can you let us be alone for a moment, officer? You guys go do your thing.” 
She led Robert, who was completely in an almost zombie-like trance over to her car. “Here, have a seat, Bob. Try to breathe.”
Robert sat down on the hood of the car and the flashback began.

Images of the battle, the eardrum shattering blast from the RPG grenade hitting the helicopter and its descent to the ground below…

“Lock on to the sound of my voice, Bob,” Tiffany said quietly as she leaned in closer to him, clasping tightly to his hand.
Tiffany’s warmth helped to pull Robert back into reality and the flashback was over. He was able to shake out of the trance, but was met once again with the current tragedy before him. The ambulance was there and the lights on top weren’t flashing. There was no use because his wife was already dead. Robert buried his head in his hands.

He was able to speak to the detective later on at the police station but he and Tiffany really didn’t want to be there. He certainly didn’t want to see the body of his dead wife. 
“Sorry detective. I’ve seen enough dead bodies to last me a lifetime,” he said.
A news reporter followed by a cameraman later walked over to the two of them outside the police station. “Mr. Vance. Hi, Jill Vargas, FOX 12.”
Robert Vance was somewhat of a celebrity due to what happened to him in Mogadishu. Most people knew who he was.
“I am deeply, deeply sorry to hear about what has happened. Can you tell us about what is going through your mind?” she asked.
Robert shook his head as tears welt up in his eyes. Tiffany held onto him tightly and quickly signaled for the reporter to leave. Robert sat on the ground and leaned up against the wheel of Tiffany’s car, bundled himself up and cried even more. She sat down next to him to comfort him.</Text>

            <Text>Yolanda Adams’s voice is amazingly beautiful. Anybody who doesn’t believe that she is on the level of Whitney Houston just isn’t listening enough. Mariah Carey is the new craze right now and all but seriously, Adams blows her away when she’s motivated. 

Those were the only thoughts going through Robert’s mind as Yolanda Adams hit the final notes of one of the best renditions of  “Amazing Grace” you’ll ever hear to a big applause from the congregation.
The church was packed and the funeral service for Diane was beautiful. It was closed casket just like Robert wanted. Diane’s brother happened to be a pastor so he was the one to give the eulogy which felt more like a sermon than a eulogy. Robert did everything in his power not to cry or cause others to feel sorry for him. The truth was that he felt empty and at this point, didn’t feel as though there was anything else to live for. He didn’t have any goals outside of being the best soldier he could be, but his flashbacks were severe and he would never be allowed to serve on a battlefield again because of it. He surely wasn’t ever going to start a family now that his wife was gone. 
After the funeral was the cemetery. Seeing his wife’s casket descend into the ground set a whole new reality in place for him. It was here he cried again but he did so alone in his car so that no one would see him. Robert never liked anyone feeling sorry for him. It was bad enough Tiffany seemed to.
There was a knock on his car window door. It was Tiffany. She was wearing jeans and the usual sweatshirt but still had her makeup on from the funeral. 
Robert wiped the tears from his face and unlocked the door. She came in and sat down next to him. They both said nothing. She simply looked him over, not really knowing what to say.
“How are you holding up?” she finally asked.
Robert didn’t answer.
“Um, Robert. I want you to stay with me for a while. I have a big guest room set up. You can stay there as long as you want. I don’t mind.”
“I’m not a baby, Tiffany,” Robert said coldly, still looking straight ahead.
Tiffany gasped. “Bob, what are you talking about?”
He leaned back and sighed. “I’m losing my mind. I’m sorry. I appreciate the offer but I think I’m gonna be OK.”
Tiffany didn’t know how to respond. She didn’t know how to tell Robert she did not believe him.</Text>

            <Text>To whom it may concern (which probably isn’t very many people),

I have made the decision that this life is not worth it anymore. When I was a kid, all I ever wanted to do was save the world and I thought I was going to be able to do that by joining the Army. Right after high school that was exactly what I did and I finally started to live what was supposed to be my dream life. Needless to say, I had no idea that my mind was too weak for such a duty as being a soldier. I now have nightmares of what happened in Mogadishu almost every night. I have constant panic attacks that put me in a deep depression that only drinking lots of beer or indulging in lots of sweets can make go away. My heavy drinking caused me not to be home for my wife when she was abducted and killed by a terrorist. I grew up wanting to save the world but I couldn’t even save her.

 Say whatever you want. I’m not going to hear it because honestly, I’m tired of living this life. So I’m done. 

- Bob

Tiffany had a sneaking suspicion that Robert was going to do something stupid.
Earlier that afternoon, she baked him a yellow cake and was going to bring it to his house. He left the door open so she simply walked in thinking that he was there and that was when she saw the suicide note laying on the couch. 
“Bob!” she cried out as she frantically moved about through the house looking for him. She looked out the window and saw his car still parked outside. She then ran upstairs.
“Bob!” she cried out again. No answer. 
She made it to the master bedroom but the door was locked. Robert never locked any of the doors in his house. She beat on the door repeatedly. Hard.
“Bob!”
She went into her purse and grabbed a hairpin. Thankfully, she was a thief as a teenager and knew how to pick locks. She easily picked this lock and opened the door.
Robert was laid out on the floor unconscious.
“Oh my God, Bob!!”
She rushed over to him, turned him over and felt his pulse. There was barely anything there and his breathing was very slow. Tiffany was a doctor and knew this wasn’t a heart attack, stroke or anything like that. This was a straight-up suicide attempt.
She rushed over to the phone and dialed 9-1-1. She cradled the phone between her head and shoulder and saw a prescription bottle laying on the carpet. She instantly knew what it was: Morphine.
“Christ…” she said to herself.
Robert just downed a lethal dose.
“911, what’s your emergency?”
“Yeah, I came in here and my friend has collapsed. He’s still breathing. Still has a pulse. He OD’d bad on morphine. Lethal dose!”
“Help is on the way, stay with me on the line, OK? Are you at 133 West Memorial Drive?”
“Yeah.”
“OK, make sure that he’s — ”
“There’s not a damn thing I can do! Get the EMT's down here now!”
She hung up the phone.
“You’re gonna be OK, Bob. You’re gonna be OK,” she said to Robert’s limp body, seemingly trying to convince herself that he would be OK when she really didn’t know if he was going to be or not.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Since Robert is a war hero, his attempted suicide is broadcast all over the news. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert survived, thank God, but was on suicide watch and therefore remained in the hospital to undergo psychiatric evaluation. While he was giving the doctors a hard time, his attempted suicide was broadcast all over the news, much to he and Tiffany’s chagrin. Being a war hero meant that everybody knew who he was and sure enough, Tiffany was bombarded with questions from reporters the minute she stepped out of the hospital. Robert told her to engage with the media and try to answer their questions because the more you didn't tell the media, the more they were going to make things up.

“Joining me now on CBS Evening News is Maj. Tiffany Lawnson, a United States Air Force physician and close friend of Vance’s. Thank you for joining us.” Dan Rather said.
“Good to be here, Dan. But please, call me Tiffany,” she responded.
“Alright, Tiffany, can you give us an update on Vance’s condition?”
“He’s fine. He’s on suicide watch. I just want to tell people not to judge him though. He’s been through a lot. A lot of people don’t know what war can do to somebody. Not only that, but he lost his wife just last week.”
“I can tell you, Tiffany, I was fortunate to have him on this show right after he came home from Somalia. He is a wonderful human being.”
“He really is. I think he just needs some time to unwind. I’m actually going on vacation to Paris next month. I think I’m going to take him along.”</Text>

            <Text>“You can’t be serious, Father,” Rebekah said as she paced around Father Quelatune’s living room, a luxurious setting with an elegant fireplace and beautiful chandelier.
“The man is suicidal! If he thinks war on Earth is bad, he’s really going to be in for a rude awakening once he comes here and has to deal with the Kwans!” 
“You really need to trust me, Rebekah,” Father Quelatune said. “Our team has been collecting lots of information from Earth’s satellites on this man. I was deeply moved by his story.”
“Yeah, but by the time news feeds from Earth’s satellites get here they’re a month old. Who knows if he’s even still alive!?” 
“Why wouldn’t he be alive?”
“Because he’s crazy, that’s why!”
“He attempted suicide because he didn’t feel as though he had anything else to live for. Maybe we can give him something to live for.”
“War ruined him. He’s too weak to help us—”
“That’s enough, Rebekah.”
Father Quelatune didn’t often raise his voice, but he did this time. 
“It is a chance we’re willing to take. I talked to the Council earlier today and he is the man we’re going with,” he said.
Rebekah placed her hands on her hips. “And you didn't think to at least run this by me first!?”
“I knew you’d object.”
Rebekah stared blankly at him.
“Besides, the decision was never going to be yours alone. I brought you here to let you know, not to seek your blessing and certainly not to ask for your permission.”
Rebekah could feel anger boiling in the pit of her stomach from that remark but she was able to hold it in. Father Quelatune was usually a mellow person but when he was mad at you, it was the worst experience in the world to be sitting across the table from him.
Rebekah glanced around momentarily. “I think it’s time for me to go.” 
“I think so too,” Quelatune said.
Rebekah grabbed the backpack that she walked in with, headed out of the room and shut the door behind her.</Text>

            <Title>Bob meets Quelatune</Title>
            <Synopsis>The Quobe comes down and news crews are everywhere. Quelatune calls for Robert to embark on an important mission.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert looked out the car window and took it all in. Paris at night is one of the most beautiful sights in the world and despite traveling all over the globe and visiting many different nations while serving in the Army, he had never been to France. 
Tiffany glanced over at him and smiled. “Beautiful huh? I told ya.” 
She then made a right-hand turn onto a main highway in their little red rental car. “Now, the last time I was here, Bob, there was this amazing restaurant called Le Château. You know how much of a planner I am so not only did I already make reservations, but I got us the VIP room which has full bottle service.”
Robert chuckled. “Man, you’re spoiling me to death, Tiff.” 
“Anything for my friend. I want to help you rehabilitate and this is the best way I know how.”
Robert leaned back and took a deep breath. For the first time in a long time he felt good. Tiffany was always there for him and without her helping him through what was the worst month of his life, he did not feel like he would have made it. 
Tiffany pulled up into a movie theater parking lot.
“You ready?” she asked.
Robert laughed. “What, to read subtitles until my eyes fall out of my sockets?” 
“Hey, I read some really, really good reviews on this movie. Besides, if we’re in Paris we might as well watch a French movie, right?”
“I’ve never seen a French movie a day in my life.” 
“You know how much trouble I had to go through to find a place that actually had subtitles for their movies in English?”
Robert rolled his eyes. He really didn’t care as long as he could be with her.

Well, at least the cinematography was good. Robert was bored out of his mind and had a lot of trouble reading the subtitled text fast enough to keep up with what was going on. He looked over at Tiffany and she seemed to be totally into the film. It’s really too bad because it was a murder mystery and he had no idea what it was even about. All he knew was that they kept replaying footage of some rich guy getting killed. 
There was then a scene of a man robbing a bank and people running for their lives. Robert was impressed with the sound production because he could hear commotion behind him in surround sound. The movie then cut to a tranquil scene of two old ladies riding in a car in the countryside. Robert still heard the same commotion behind him. At this point, he had a feeling that the commotion behind him wasn’t coming from this crappy film because it made no sense in this scene. He looked behind him and saw through the crack of the closed double-doors people moving about quickly. Something was going on out there. Others looked behind them as well.
Robert was a lot more curious about what was going on in the lobby than this movie. “Tiff, what’s going on out there?” 
Somebody got up and left along with two others whose curiosities were also piqued. Tiffany and Robert glanced at each other, nodded and headed out as well.
They made their way into the lobby and several people were headed outside. A crowd of people were in the parking lot and the street looking up into the sky.
Robert and Tiffany made their way outside and the wind was blowing really hard. Tiffany’s hair blew every which way. She quickly tied it up with a band as they both looked up into the sky. The clouds were swirling around quickly and very unnaturally. In the clouds they could see a small box-like object slowly coming down from the sky.
Tiffany mumbled in awe, “What the hell is that?” 
One person went into his car and turned on his handheld camcorder.
The box descended further down. A wave of awe swept over the large gathering. Even more people were getting out of their cars and traffic was at a complete standstill. The box-like UFO descended down even further. It almost looked as if the box was descending toward their location.
Robert then saw flashing police lights in his peripheral. Police officers, many of them, tried to restore order but a lot of them were looking up into the sky themselves. The wind was still howling and the crowd was growing by the minute to the point that it looked as though either the biggest parade or the biggest riot in Parisian history was about to take place. A police officer could be heard yelling something over a megaphone in French. Tiffany nor Robert could understand a word. All they could do was look at what all the other people were doing and follow suit. 
The citizens were all clearing the streets and heading toward the sidewalks. More squad cars came along and eventually started blocking off large sections of the avenue. A helicopter loomed overhead as the box continued its descent. It looked like a silver cube that was about ten feet tall and ten feet wide. The box definitely seemed to be descending toward them.
The box was only about fifteen stories above them now, even lower than some of the buildings in the area. Several people instinctively started to make a run for it at this point. The police lights from the countless squad cars blocking off the avenue reflected on the cube’s shimmering finish.
The cube landed gently in the middle of the street. Heavily armed police officers trained their weapons on the object and surrounded it. The clicking of rifles  was the only sound that was made as the people were instantly silent in anticipation. 
One of the faces of the cube slowly came down to reveal Father Quelatune and Rebekah, both in ceremonial robes. Inside the cube looked like a mini laboratory of lights, buttons and switches. There were instant awes and lots of flash photography. Quelatune and Rebekah stepped out onto the street and looked around. The police still had their guns drawn.
 Quelatune said to the police in perfect French, “Please, we come in peace.”
The police slowly began to put their weapons down.
Quelatune looked everyone over. Everyone was in shock and terrified. There were reporters everywhere as well as cameras. Quelatune nodded to one of the reporters, a pretty Asian woman with a microphone who quickly went over to him. Several cameras moved over near her and all pointed them at Quelatune and Rebekah.
“I want to let each and every one of you know that it is OK to be alarmed. It is OK to be scared. But rest assured, we are coming in peace,” he said. This seemed to calm many of the people down.
“My name is Father Kai Quelatune and this is Rebekah. We come from a world that is very far from yours. We came here today because we need your help. One of your own is an individual whose story we were deeply moved by. All month we were able to pull signals from various news sources from your planet’s satellites. We ask that you forgive us for the invasion of your privacy, but…”
Quelatune then looked directly at Robert. “You, young man. Robert Vance.”
Everyone turned to look at Robert. Robert felt extremely uncomfortable. There were several murmurs in the very large crowd.
 Tiffany whispered, “He knows who you are!”
Robert pointed at himself in a “who me?” sort of fashion.
Quelatune motioned for Robert to come to him again. “Please, Robert, could you come forward for me?”
Robert didn’t trust this man, or alien or whatever you want to call him.
“How do I know that you’re safe?” Robert asked.
“I understand. I want you to know that this trip here to Earth was very expensive and extremely unpopular with the government of my home country on the planet I come from. I would not waste such resources in coming all the way here just  to harm you. Please, come forward.” 
There was something trusting about Quelatune. Robert nodded and came forward. There were more murmurs in the crowd. They were becoming restless. Police tried to restore order.
“Robert, a month ago you tried to take your own life. It was broadcast all over your planet’s news because you are a war hero. You felt at that time you had nothing else to live for, correct?” he asked.
Robert did not feel comfortable talking about this in front of everyone to see. He quickly glanced around him and then addressed Quelatune. “Look, sir, I don’t know who you are or where you come from, but I’m not about to talk about that in front of all these people.”
“Robert, we want for you to come to our planet and help us save it,” Quelatune said.
Everyone around him responded with even more shock and awe. Basically, Quelatune was asking Robert to go with him to another planet. 
Robert laughed. “I’m not going to another planet! You out of your mind!?”
“If you don’t help us, Robert, millions of people’s lives could be lost,” Quelatune said.
Robert looked around at all of the people.
“Our planet was invaded by extra-terrestrials known as the Kwans. They subjugated and colonized every single nation on our planet except for ours. We’re next on their agenda. These people are extremely cruel to the natives of our planet and put many of them into slave labor. Once a year, they sacrifice one hundred children to their false god by burning them at the stake. Robert, if you choose to help us in our campaign, we can stop them once and for all. Another thing you must consider is that once they have completely taken over our planet, what will stop them from coming to yours? You have the opportunity to change all of that. Didn’t you say that your dream was to save the world?”
Robert laughed again. “I meant this world.”
“Look at us, Robert. We’re no different from you. The human race isn’t as unique as you Earthlings think. There are several planets whose inhabitants are no different from yours. We’re all part of the same human family, can’t you see that?”
Robert looked around at all of the Frenchmen huddled around him and the thousands who had lined up down the streets to see what all of this was about. 
“Do you guys think I should do this!?” Robert asked everyone around him.
Everyone in the crowd began to cheer. That was a yes. Robert was still not sure though.
“Father Quelatune, look I—”
“Robert, we’re not asking you to make a decision right now. Just know that you are the only person that our council has agreed upon, which means that by the time we find somebody else, it may be too late.”
“What exactly am I gonna be doing?” Robert asked.
Father Quelatune smiled. “Basically, Robert, what you do best: being the best military leader our nation will ever have.”
Quelatune headed back over to the box. “In exactly ten days, 7 AM your time, Robert, I will find you and I will want to know if you are in or if you are out.” 
Quelatune and Rebekah headed back inside the box, its door lifted up, shut and rose back up into the sky and into the clouds.</Text>

            <Synopsis>The news media is all over Robert on if he will accept the mission. Scientists are dumbfounded by the event too.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Every channel on television was largely wall-to-wall coverage of the incident that took place in Paris. The debate seemed to be on whether or not this was a hoax set up by Robert to get attention and if it wasn’t, what his decision was going to be. Robert’s phone constantly rang off the hook day in and day out. He was staying with Tiffany and her son as it was still too painful for him to be in his house alone, even after a month since his wife’s death.
Robert was bottle feeding Tiffany’s son in the guest bedroom he was staying in. He heard a knock at the door.
“Come in,” he said.
Tiffany peeped in. “Hey.”
“Hey.”
“Hey, little man,” she cooed as Robert handed Michael over to her. 
She cradled Michael in her arms and re-directed her attention to Robert. “You haven’t left the house all day. The phone is ringing off the hook. You ever gonna talk to the media about what happened?” 
She looked over at the television. Robert was watching CNN, and the only thing that was being covered all day long was the incident that took place the other night in Paris. At the moment, an astrophysicist was being interviewed about aliens being among us and looking just like humans.
“They’re calling what happened the biggest discovery of the 20th century, or the biggest hoax of the 20th century depending on who you ask. Skeptics are claiming that you set this all up for attention—”
“I don’t care what they think,” Robert said, turning toward Tiffany. “Those people are judging me. They have the nerve to think that because my wife died, that I’m in a state of mind crazed enough to plot a hoax so elaborate that not even the world’s top scientists can figure it out, like I can control the weather! Everybody felt the wind. Everybody saw the storm when they were coming down. That’s not natural. Meteorologists were even able to pick it up. So tell me how I was able to plot that, huh!? These people are stupid.” 
He had been wanting to get that out for a while. It was understandable why he wanted to get away from it all. He knew that he was the single most important man on the planet at the moment. These aliens from another world chose him specifically.
“At the very least, can you talk to them so they’d leave me alone?” Tiffany asked. “While you were asleep this morning, news crews were pounding at the door. I had to shoo them all away and tell them I’d call the police if they ever came back.”
There was another knock at the door in the living room. Tiffany and Robert looked at each other.
They got up and headed downstairs toward the door. Tiffany looked through the peephole and who she saw did not look like reporters. These were men in suits.
Tiffany looked back at Robert and whispered, “Bob, I think it’s the feds.”</Text>

            <Title>FBI gets involved</Title>
            <Text>“We don’t want you to feel as though this is an interrogation. We just want you to be safe more than anything,” one of the FBI agents said. He was a handsome bespectacled man in his late-40’s, trying to speak in as gentle a tone as he could. They were both sitting and sipping coffee on the couch with Robert and Tiffany.
Robert took a sip of coffee. “I understand why you guys are here. What happened was weird. I don’t get it either. I don’t know why they singled me out specifically but they did.”
“Well, you’re a war hero, Bob,” Tiffany said.
“That’s right,” the bespectacled man said in agreement. “We spoke to the President about this and he’s still not sure whether or not you should embark upon this mission. It’s up to you. Have you made a decision yet?”
Robert shook his head. “I haven’t.”
“Can you make one now?” asked the other FBI agent, a young African-American man in his early 30’s.
“I don’t think that this meeting is going anywhere,” Tiffany said, seeing Robert becoming more and more uncomfortable. “News crews have been coming to this house all day long and we just want it to stop. Bob will make the decision when he makes the decision. That’s really all we can tell you at this point. I’m sorry.” 
The two FBI agents looked at each other. The bespectacled man pulled out his pager and looked at it. At that, they both nodded at each other and got up.
“You’re absolutely right, Tiffany. This isn’t really going anywhere. We’ll see to it that the press leaves you alone,” the black agent said.
He then handed Tiffany and Robert cards. “If you need anything, day or night, there’s a direct line to us, OK?”
“Sure. Thanks,” she said as she and Robert took the cards.
The two feds headed out.
There was an awkward silence after they left.
“What?” Tiffany asked as Robert threw her a look.
“I’m going upstairs,” Robert said.
“Bob, you don’t need anyone bothering you about this.”
Robert turned around as he headed up the stairs. “I didn’t sleep well last night. I’m just gonna take a nap.”</Text>

            <Text>Robert woke up from his nap. It was dark outside. He looked over at the alarm clock near his bed and it was 9:30 PM. He slept for a long time but felt rested. 
He went downstairs and saw Tiffany sitting on the couch in her pajamas watching television rocking Michael. She looked up and saw Robert coming down the stairs.
“You’re up,” she said, turning down the volume with her remote.
“Yeah,” he said. “Tiffany, I decided what I was going to do.”
This got her attention as she sat up.
“I’m gonna go, but only if you’re OK with it.”
“Bob, if you wanna do this, I’ll support you.”
“Tiffany, think about this for a moment,” he said as he sat down next to her, taking her hand. The softness of her skin softened him.
“I might not ever come back.”
She looked down, almost as if this had just dawned on her.
“I want you to think about this,” he said.
At that, he got up from the couch and headed toward the kitchen.</Text>

            <Title>Tiffany's Story</Title>
            <Text>Tiffany stared down at the floor, unable to get back into whatever it was she was watching on television. She knew that she benefited from taking care of Robert just as much as he benefited from her taking care of him. For the first time in her life since her husband passed away, an adult actually appreciated her, cared about being loved and nurtured by her and wanted to be around her. 
She grew up with one older sister, Lauren, who is two years older than she is. Lauren was a quiet kid who hardly ever got into trouble. Tiffany was anything but. Their parents constantly fought after she was born and as a result, neglected her and Lauren. Tiffany was a troublemaker all throughout her formative years and ran away from home when she was only fourteen.  After running away, she tried to return home two years later but her parents wouldn’t take her back despite Lauren’s pleas for them to do so. Her parents all but disowned her after that. And while her relationship with them has improved over the years now that she was an adult, it has not improved by much although her relationship with Lauren had always been strong. 
Tiffany also got into all kinds of trouble with the law, from selling drugs to petty theft, the latter of which got her six months in a juvenile detention center. She did very poorly in school bouncing around from foster home to foster home after running away.
She took the SAT test her senior year of high school and scored a 1590, indicating that she was beyond the level of a genius despite her bad behavior and was able to get a full-ride scholarship to Harvard. This time, she got serious, studied hard and graduated with a 4.0. She went to medical school and during her time there, her friends set her up on a blind date with a man from New York: a West Point cadet who would later become her husband, Randall Lawnson. Their blind date went horribly but the two fell in love, settled down and got married two years later. Tiffany and Randy both joined the military. He went to the Army and she went to the Air Force.
Robert, Randy’s best friend, was always there to comfort Tiffany during her time of bereavement after Robert died. Robert and his late wife Diane were selfless in taking care of her, giving her money, letting her stay over whenever she wanted and caring for her son whenever she was busy. She and her son became a part of their family. Robert in particular really bonded with Michael. Diane had a T-shaped uterus and was told there was a chance she would not be able to have children. They changed Michael’s diapers, read to him at night and treated him as though he were their own. Tiffany owed it to Robert to return the favor during his time of need in the same way he and his wife did for her.
The decision was now hers whether or not Robert was going to be visiting a world the likes of which no one from Earth had ever seen. There was an excellent chance he could never return. She knew how real that possibility was. She could not bear the thought of losing someone else in her life at that moment. She could not bear the thought of Michael losing someone else either. She also felt compassion for the many lives at stake in the world in which Robert has been asked to visit. Father Quelatune mentioned children who were not only enslaved but also being burned at the stake. She imagined her own child being in a situation like that and an individual from another world being given the opportunity to save him and many others and that person refusing to do so. She imagined how much she would hate that individual with a passion. 
It would be downright hypocritical to forbid Robert from going. It would be immoral not to encourage him to go. That being said, Robert just lost his wife. He’s a broken man who has severe PTSD flashbacks under even the most benign circumstances. That was not lost on her and was not going to be lost on the people on this other planet who would be depending on him. It was a reality that haunted her. She knew deep down that as talented a pilot and tactician Robert might have been, going alone into an unknown world of war would mess him up badly and he would be of almost no use to them. He would be sent home embarrassed, feeling like a failure.
There was morally no good reason for Robert not to go with Father Quelatune to this new world, but given the circumstances, there was no way Tiffany could allow him to go into this new world alone.</Text>

            <Title>Tiffany's blessing</Title>
            <Synopsis>She meets Robert while he's at the graveyard mourning his family and tells him she'll only give blessing if she joins him.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next day, Robert was up early and headed out to the graveyard in which his wife Diane was buried. It was cold so he had on layers of clothing along with his coat. He felt the need to see his wife’s grave one last time before he left.
He had no doubt that he would gain Tiffany’s blessing in embarking upon this mission. He knew that she knew he would be unable to live with himself if he declined. Not only that, but how would the world see him? They’d see him as a coward and he would see himself as one.
At that moment, the sound of Tiffany’s car pulling up became audible to him. He turned around and saw her park near the entrance of the cemetery. She stepped out of the car wearing a long coat similar to his. 
“Hi, Bob,” she called out as she made her way over toward him.
“How did you know I was gonna be here?” he asked as she caught up to him.
She laughed. “I know you too well.” 
Robert turned toward the marble tombstone.
“Not a day goes by you don’t think about her, huh?” 
Robert shook his head and stared ahead. 
Tiffany’s gloved hand took his. “Bob, I want you to go on this trip.” 
Robert knew there was more.
She added, “But I want to come with you.”
Robert slowly turned around. He was both shocked and relieved at the same time by her words. 
“Tiff, you don’t have to—”
“I know. I know I don’t have to go with you. But Bob, you and I both know that you’re not the same as you were before.”
“You talking about my PTSD?”
Robert turned fully toward her and stared at her dead in the eye. He could see so much concern on her face he couldn’t stay mad at her for very long. He put his arm around her as they made their way back through the cemetery gate. “Tiffany, I’d love for you to come with me if that’s what you want.”
“I wouldn’t want it any other way, Bob.”
Robert felt far more at ease about this mission knowing that Tiffany would be joining him. If Father Quelatune didn’t want to bring them both, they could simply tell him that they weren’t interested.</Text>

            <Text>As supportive as Robert was in Tiffany joining him, taking Michael along was completely out of the question. Michael would have to stay on Earth until Tiffany came back. That would mean her parents or sister would have to take care of him while she was gone. 
Tiffany knew there was no chance her parents would do it. She simply didn’t have a good relationship with them. Her sister Lauren, however, might oblige.
Lauren is two years older than Tiffany and is a stay at home mother. She married a successful architect and has two children. Tiffany wasn’t sure if Lauren was going to be up for taking care of a third child but she knew Lauren was the best candidate out of anyone. 

Tiffany was also back in the news after the story broke that she would be joining Robert. She did a round of interviews with CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC. Local news crews were right back at her doorstep all day and night. Several people around the world offered to join her and Robert on their mission but authorities weren’t having it. Two people from Earth going to an unknown planet was bad enough.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Robert is still trying to learn how to summon Timothy, the Rulose god of Fire but isn't having much luck.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert was dealing with the aftermath of the failed mission and Amaga’s subsequent death in his own way. He knew that while his powers have gotten much stronger since his operation, he still had a long way to go before being able to fully realize his powers. He knew that had he been able to call upon the Rulose god of fire, Timothy, the Kwans wouldn’t have stood a chance. He felt he should have been further along than he was. He began training in Castlerock everyday without his gloves where before, he trained every other day. He was finally able to throw fireballs consistently and hit targets without the gloves. He wrote down and tracked his progress. Unfortunately, he didn’t know the first thing about summoning an actual god from the Spirit World and neither did anyone else.
“Timothy! I call upon you!” he shouted, jumping up and down in an open training field with his hands up. Tiffany stood watch with her hands on her hips, laughing. It was early morning and it had just finished raining so the sky was cloudy and gray.
Robert stomped with frustration. “This is hopeless. I don’t know the first thing about summoning a god. Is this Timothy even real?”
“You’re making progress, Robert, relax,” Tiffany reassured as she walked over to him.
He sighed. “I wish I would have been able to call upon Timothy when we were up there on that mission. It sure as hell would have helped.”
Tiffany could hear the frustration in his voice. She wanted to comfort him but didn’t know exactly how to. She could see he felt somewhat responsible for everything.
“Robert, even if you could have called upon Timothy, there’s probably no way you would have been able to save Amaga. She was fifty miles away from your ship. She was in a completely different area from you.”
“I know, I know. I don’t know what I’m saying, actually,” he said, his voice trailing off as he looked into the sky.
“Robert?” Tiffany asked.
No response. Robert’s eyes widened.

The loud blast of shots rang all around the X2 as Robert’s heart pounded. 
“Abort! Abort!” crew members screamed.

Robert could barely breath as he fell to his hands and knees. The entire place was spinning. He could feel his heart pounding out of his chest. Tiffany tightly held onto him.
“Robert, hang on to my words, OK?”
Robert could hear her but his body wasn’t responding the way it normally would. His heart rate increased. The place was turning purple.
“Tiffany, this is bad…help,” Robert barely choked out.
His heart rate was pounding even faster. He was quickly beginning to lose consciousness.

Boooom! Booom! Boooom! The X2 rocked as it took heavy shots. Robert stared helplessly at the radar. It was completely dead.
“The radar! The radar!” Robert screamed.

“Robert! Stay with me, Robert,” Tiffany pleaded. 
Robert was drifting further and further away as he a blacked out.</Text>

            <Title>Rebekah forgiven</Title>
            <Synopsis>Smoke goes to bat for Rebekah and fights for her to get another job. He mentions that Rebekah was against the mission and therefore shouldn't be held accountable. Rebekah is demoted to being head of the newly rebuilt medical facility.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“I’m sorry you all had to witness that,” Father Quelatune said. “How is everyone feeling?”
Most everyone said they felt fine even if they didn’t really mean it. Smoke raised his hand.
“This might surprise some of you, but I don’t think Rebekah should be out of a job completely.”
“What makes you say that, Smoke?” Quelatune asked.
Smoke answered. “Let me say that if there is anyone who is still broken up about Amaga’s death it is me. There’s not a day that has gone by that I haven’t thought about her. That being said, it was Rebekah who was against this mission all along.”
Tiffany butted in. “Of course she would be against it! She’s on their side!”
“But there’s no proof of that right now,” Smoke said. “That’s a really heavy accusation to make of someone.”
“But we know that somebody in this room is a mole,” Marxis interjected. “There’s only a handful of people who have access to the backup database. There’s only a few people who knew about the mission to begin with. There’s only a few people who had access to the ships’ data files. Rebekah checks all of those boxes.”
“I understand that,” Smoke said. “So yeah, I agree that maybe she shouldn’t be Chief Technology Officer anymore. But does that mean she shouldn’t have a job anymore?”
“Smoke,” Father Quelatune said. “Does this have anything to do with Rebekah’s son, Skyler?”
Smoke didn’t respond.
“I know you and her son have bonded, Smoke. I know you often would babysit for her.”
“I’m not going to lie and say I don’t care for him,” Smoke answered.
“We all do,” Tiffany said. “But lives are at stake here.”
“I get that,” Smoke conceded. “Look, how about you guys make her head of the newly rebuilt medical facility. How much harm could she possibly do there?”
“A lot,” Tiffany said. “Remember what happened to the medical facility the first time?” Do you really want them to blow it up again?”
“You’re missing my point, Tiff,” Smoke said. “The new medical facility has a direct link to Rulose intelligence now. We beefed up the security twenty-fold. It is the most secure wing of the Rulose Temple, second only to Father Quelatune’s quarters. Rebekah will live there and literally everything she does on any computer she owns will be traced, tracked and recorded. So if she orders for that wing of the Temple to be destroyed again we’ll know it ahead of time.”
“I’m actually liking the sound of this,” Father Quelatune chimed in. “The more I think about it, the more I actually do want Rebekah to continue to work for us. That way we can keep an eye on her. If she’s out running around unemployed we can’t do that. Who knows what she could plan outside of our watch?”
“So who’s gonna tell her?” Robert asked.
“I’m the President,” Quelatune said. “So it’s my responsibility to tell her myself.”

Surprisingly, Rebekah took the job without any resistance, saying that she understood why there was suspicion around her, even going as far as to apologize to Tiffany later that evening, stopping by her quarters to talk.
“I’ve been through a lot lately,” Rebekah said. “I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. For everything.”
Tiffany wasn’t completely sure if she could trust Rebekah yet but she also knew there wasn’t possibly anything she could have access to in the medical facility that wasn’t carefully monitored. If there was anywhere Rebekah could be outed as a mole informant, it would be as director of the medical facility. The idea was that she was either going to be given sufficient rope to hang herself or this would genuinely be a fresh start for her.</Text>

            <Title>Rebekah is fired</Title>
            <Synopsis>Rebekah is forced to step down due to plane incident. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Tiffany sat in her bathrobe on the couch of her large, luxurious living room which used to be Rebekah’s, eating cereal. The TV was off and the room was silent. It was early in the morning and she knew what was coming up. A boardroom meeting was set up to formally relieve Rebekah of her duties as Chief Technology Officer of the Air Force. On one hand, she relished the idea of putting the bitch in her place. Memories of Rebekah berating her in the office that was once hers replayed in her mind. It was now Tiffany who would be firing her. 
She also felt more than ever that Rebekah orchestrated this entire thing. She despised Amaga and probably didn’t appreciate her being dressed down at the briefing in front of all those military personnel. The more Tiffany thought about the upcoming meeting, the more she couldn’t wait to stand over Rebekah’s shoulder as she signed her resignation paper.

The boardroom was full of the most distinguished individuals of the Rulose government. Father Quelatune, Tiffany, Smoke, Robert, Tyros the Senior Counselor, Leoma, who survived the A1 disaster since her evacuation pod worked as well as Marxis were all present. Rebekah, of course, was there too. At the time she didn’t know she was about to be let go but she was about to find out because Father Quelatune cut right to the chase.
“Not only was the Amelrak mission an abject failure, but a horrible tragedy. I decided that we hold this meeting two weeks after the incident first of all so that we all can decompress from the terrible events that occurred, but also that we may investigate what caused this all to happen to begin with.”
Quelatune looked everyone over before continuing. Everyone was silent. Robert observed Rebekah’s face to see if anything was suspect. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.
“We were successfully able to find out exactly what went wrong,” Quelatune said. “First of all, the Kwans knew well in advance what our strategy was going to be. This was why they were able to populate the area with anti-aircraft guns right before we got there. This is how they were also able to tamper with our aircraft too. Not only were they told this classified information by an informant, but they also somehow had access to the data files of our ships as well as the backup database and its login information that is literally on another planet.”
Quelatune paused for another moment, then said, “It had to have been one of you in this room who was responsible.”
Everyone was quiet. Robert saw several eyes on Rebekah. Rebekah quickly noticed.
“Let me guess, it’s my fault right?” she said defensively.
Father Quelatune didn’t play around. “You are one of only five people who had access to the backup database that curiously became corrupt the morning of the mission. You’re the CTO of the Air Force and you live in Castlerock so you had access to the ships and their data files. If anyone could have seen to it that these ships were hijacked to kill a high ranking government official you had an altercation with right before the mission, it was you.”
“This is ridiculous! This is because I’m a Kwan!”
“No. This is because all signs point to you,” Robert said.
“Oh, you too now, huh, Robert?” Rebekah asked coldly. “You want a job or do you want Tiffany’s love box!?”
Tiffany had it. “Rebekah, you’re fired.”
Rebekah gasped, surprised it just came out like that.
“That’s why we held this meeting to begin with,” she continued. “You were brought here for us to tell you that. We just simply came to the conclusion that you can’t be trusted. Either you were behind it and we can’t prove it, or you were grossly incompetent and couldn’t do your job. Either way, we don’t want you working as Chief Technology Officer anymore. And yes, the decision is final.”
Rebekah continued not to speak. Her eyes burned with anger.
“Is this true, Father?” Rebekah finally asked.
Quelatune said, “You will be relieved of your duties by the end of this week, Rebekah.”
“I can’t believe this!” she exclaimed. “So much for Rulose law and order! Because I’m a Kwan, I’m guilty ‘till proven innocent!”
“Are you done?” Tiffany asked coldly.
Rebekah stared at Tiffany with hatred. “You cold-hearted bitch! I swear on my son you will pay for ruining my life.”
“Death threats to a high-ranking government official is tantamount to high treason, so try me,” Tiffany responded.
Rebekah got up from her seat and walked out.</Text>

            <Title>Damning research</Title>
            <Synopsis>Rulose officials led by Marxis do research on the downed battleship of Amaga and Leoma, the A1. They find that the engine was almost deliberately tampered with as there was no way Lemor-Ixa could have hi-jacked the jet's signal in the way she so easily did with the box.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Rulose intelligence was able to determine that it was indeed Lemor-Ixa who orchestrated the hijacking of all three ships, tampering with their communications before the mission even went underway, proving they were informed in advance. It was Lemor-Ixa who tampered with Amaga’s evacuation device as well, preventing her from being able to evacuate from the A1 with the others when it was shot down. Intelligence assumed it would be too labor-intensive to go and disable every evacuation device in the A1 so they only chose Amaga’s.
According to the published design docs of the A1 which by Rulose law, is public record, a group of university research engineers were able to find in an independent study that there was no way any outsider could have possibly hijacked its controls. The same was said about the X1 and X2. The reason was because the only way any ship’s systems could be hijacked was if it was able to download and install programs while operating. But this feature has never been available for any Rulose battle ship. That would mean if there was anything installed on these battle ships that allowed Lemor-Ixa to control them, they had to have been installed beforehand at the base in Castlerock.
Father Quelatune, Tiffany, Marxis and Robert felt that all signs pointed to Rebekah. Rebekah was Chief Technology Officer of the Rulose Air Force, living in Castlerock. Even if she wasn’t directly responsible for the ships being hacked, the X2 and A1 were both under her care so it was still her responsibility to ensure that nothing like that would ever happen to them. If Kwans broke into the Air Force base and hacked into the the X2 and A1’s files, surely Rebekah would have, or should have known about it. It was also her job to oversee diagnostic testing for the three ships, including the rebels’ X1 prior to them being used in a major mission. She had days to get all of this done. Researchers both in Angelina and Castlerock confirmed that a thorough diagnostic test for each of the ships beforehand would have prevented any of them from leaving the runway that morning. The crew should not have had to find out while they were already up in the air being attacked that their ships had been hacked into. Therefore, either Rebekah was behind these hacks or was grossly incompetent. All Father Quelatune knew was this: Rebekah had absolutely no business being anywhere near a Rulose combat aircraft ever again.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Amaga's jet plane was shot down and was also hi-jacked by Lemor-Ixa. Smoke wants revenge and it angry.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Funeral services were arranged for all who were killed during the catastrophic mission failure in Amelrak, including for Amaga and Cypher. Father Quelatune spoke to the nation right outside the Rulose Temple, addressing the Rulose citizens in a somber tone and took full responsibility for the events that occurred, but in the back of his mind, he knew this wasn’t completely his fault. 
After memorial services, Smoke’s sadness turned into anger. He wanted revenge. Father Quelatune grieved Amaga’s death as well. She was like a granddaughter to him. He knew that Smoke felt the most pain and needed the most comfort. Smoke desperately wanted revenge, to drop a nuclear bomb on the Kwans or assassinate Queen Riptide. Father Quelatune knew these were both disastrous ideas and deep down, Smoke did as well.
Tiffany was mortified. She developed somewhat of a bond with Amaga and not only that, she just naturally didn’t take loss very well. The mood was dark and hopeless in the Rulose Temple. The mood across the nation was anger. Father Quelatune knew he had to make things right. 
He ordered a full investigation on the destruction of the three battleships and what caused their communications to fail. He needed to get to the bottom of how the Kwans not only knew about the mission in advance and therefore was able to prepare for it, but also what was being built in these factories and how it was going to affect their national security.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Robert tests out his new weapons in a kick-ass scene where he fights off several android soldiers in a training mission.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Rebekah and Robert were back in the shuttle flying low over the city. Robert looked out the window as they flew over the industrial sector at the manufacturing plants and factories manned by workers and robots. They later ended up flying north to the outskirts of town several miles out, eventually to a large mountain range. The shuttle landed on a plateau. They were so far from the city that the skyline wasn’t even visible from where they were. Rebekah and Robert, who was heavily armed and ready for battle, left the shuttle and trekked on foot another mile to a large nearby cave sealed by metal sliding doors. They were met by armed guards standing outside of a large armored vehicle. 
“Man, this place is intense,” Robert said looking around.
“Yep,” Rebekah responded. “Alright, Bob. This is a real-world battle simulation you’re going to experience in this dark, enclosed space. You want to make sure you hit your targets accurately and not fire away with reckless abandon because you could set things on fire you didn’t intend to and it could be a situation. Fighting in a burning cave of sulfur and limestone is a lot harder than you might think, OK?”
“Who exactly am I gonna be battling in this cave?” Robert asked.
“There are androids in there that are going to attack you. They’re not going to go easy on you either. I’ll shut them all off if we sense you are in any real danger. They are armed with guns, but they are shooting rubber bullets that won’t kill you. “
Robert grew anxious.
“We want to test your powers in as realistic a situation as possible. We feel you’re ready now.”
She pulled out a stopwatch. “I’m also gonna be timing you.”
Robert sighed. “Oh wonderful.”
“Alright, Robert. You ready?”
The doors of the cave slid open. It was pitch black inside as Robert felt the cave’s cold wet draft.
Before even stepping inside, he saw the red bionic eyes of patrolling humanoid androids deep within the cave.
He put on his goggles and could see everything as he walked in. The cave was actually factory-like with conveyor belts, rafters, cranes and stairs going up multiple levels of the stone walls. Androids patrolled each of the levels and he also saw cameras everywhere.
The doors of the cave shut behind him. He was alone now save for Rebekah able to speak to him through his earpiece.
“Alright Robert,” she said softly to him in his ear. “Your goal is to grab the prize at the end, which is going to be a blue balloon.”
 Suddenly, a bright, floating blue balloon appeared in the distance at the far other end of the factory cave.
“There it is. You see it? Just simply nod if you do. I can track your motions.”
Robert nodded.
“Good,” she said. “The androids are ignoring you now but as soon as I actually start the sim, they’re going to notice you.”
Robert didn’t even notice she had not even started the sim yet. Oh boy…
“Alright, Robert. In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Go!”
Suddenly an alarm went off. The androids down below went on full alert.
“Intruder!” a robotic voice called out over the loudspeakers.
Robert was ready. He ran down one of the hallways as androids level with him came out of nowhere and ran after him. 
Brrrrrang! Automatic weapons fired at him but the bullets hit walls.
He hid behind a wall and aimed at an android approaching him. He fired. The android instantly went up in flames.
An android grabbed him from behind. Robert was taken aback by how incredibly strong it was. Its cybernetic limbs wrapped around him tighter than any human ever could and put him in a rear-naked choke. He instantly began to lose consciousness.
Robert elbowed it in the head and struck it in the sternum with an open-palmed strike. The android flew back, engulfed in flames. Robert was surprised he was able to even do that. His powers were beginning to work for him rather than the other way around.
“Awesome job, Bob!” Rebekah called out to him through his earpiece.
Robert ran out from the wall and onward to the balloon, which was still a ways off. There was a clearing as androids ambushed and surrounded him. They immediately fired their weapons but he hit a button on his belt right in the nick of time. A glowing orange transparent shield of energy surround him, causing every bullet to disintegrate before making contact. After a few seconds, Robert began feeling dizzy and tired. 
Rebekah cried out, “Don’t have that on for too long Robert! You’re losing spirit energy!”
Robert pulled out one of his magic grenades and tossed it. 
Booooom! The place shook with an explosion of fire and magic. Every android around him was dead and going up in flames as smoke clouded his vision. The walls around him were burning in flames as well. His lungs began to sting.
“Whoah!” he cried out, coughing.
Two more androids up in the rafters started firing at him. He jumped out of the way, landing hard on his side. Pain radiated through his entire body as smoke blinded him. Perhaps using a grenade in such a small space was a bad idea.
“You gotta get out of there, you’re burning the whole place down!” Rebekah said.
Robert fired at the two androids up in the rafters but wasn’t able to hit either target. Not only was his vision impaired but he was feeling so tired and dizzy he could barely hold up his weapon.
“You’re using a lot more magic than you normally would in a battle like this so I know you’re tired. Try to conserve!” Rebekah advised.
He then heard something metal drop near him that started rolling closer and closer to him. His heart raced, knowing exactly what it was.
“Grenade!” Rebekah cried out.
Robert instantly picked it up and threw it back at the androids up in the rafters.
The grenade exploded in mid air, the blast of heat and some of the shrapnel smacked him in the face. He hit the ground back first, the back of his head bouncing on the hard metal ground. Despite wearing a heavy helmet, he felt like his skull was cracked open. His head throbbed in pain.
Robert picked up his weapon and fired again. He missed as another part of the cave went up in flames. The androids fired at him again but they missed as Robert heard bullets whiz by him. They couldn’t get a clear shot either through all the smoke.
He focused hard and charged up a large fireball in his hands and launched it. The fireball flew from his hands with a fat trail of black smoke and hit both targets with an explosion of fire and light. That was the most powerful fireball he has ever thrown by far. 
“All clear, Robert!” Rebekah said joyously. “Now it’s time to get to that balloon!”
Robert saw the glowing blue-green balloon in the distance. He trudged his way over to it, going up two flights of stairs and making his way over large walls of sandbags to get to it. He then went down some stairs and across a ramp, finally grabbing the floating balloon by the string. The door to the other side opened. Rebekah was waiting.
Robert’s legs felt like jelly as the door shut behind him and he dropped his weapon, fell on his knees and threw off his helmet and goggles.
The cool air of the outdoors felt good against his skin. He looked out in the distance at the mountains, trees and blue sky, thankful he got through that hell. 
“Bob, you nailed it!” Rebekah said excitedly, looking at her stopwatch. “You got through all of that in less than 15 minutes. We were expecting it to take about 20 minutes at the least.”
Robert was happy to hear that.
“That test you just did is the top most difficult infantry test we have here on Rulose Island,” Rebekah said. “Only two others in the history of Rulose Island have been able to get through it. One of them was Amaga but it took her nearly a half-hour. But here’s the thing, Bob; we made it three times as difficult for you. Normally, there’s only three androids in that cave. For you, there were ten. With these new powers, you really are a super soldier.”
Robert removed his Kevlar vest.
“I can barely stand, though,” he said breathlessly.
“You’re spirit energy is pretty low right now because you used so much magic. Over time it will regenerate. You just need food, fluids and rest.”
Robert could use a burger right about then.
“Keep in mind that you were exclusively using your magic,” Rebekah continued. “In a normal battle situation you’ll have other weapons besides just your magic. Not only that, but as you use your magic and it gets stronger, you'll be able to use your magic more and more often without getting tired.” 
Rebekah helped him remove the rest of his armor to the point he was eventually back in his regular training clothes. The chilly outside air and his pores open from his body drenched in sweat made him shiver. 
“I think we’re gonna call it a day,” Rebekah said. She then smiled. “Be careful with those grenades. Your magic is stronger than you think. Not only that, but those grenades are filled with the same material used In your magic amplifying gloves.”
“They’re amazing,” Robert said in awe, picking one up and examining it.
“Yeah. They’re pretty cool, and you’re welcome. I designed them.”
She then glanced at her watch and helped him up. “Let’s get outta here. You can leave all your stuff here. Amaga’s ordered a cleanup crew.”
They were back on the shuttle on their way back to Angelina. Robert felt good. For the first time he felt like he had something no other soldier had. For the first time, he felt like he truly knew why he was brought all the way from Earth to this strange but amazing planet. He knew there was still much more progress to be made. He wanted to master his powers. The idea of summoning a god from the Spirit World capable of wiping out an tire battalion captivated him.
This great training day couldn’t have come at a better time either. Because little did he or Rebekah know at the time that Father Quelatune was soon going to arrange for Robert to embark upon a mission where he would need every bit of his new found powers and then some.</Text>

            <Title>Robert's new wpns</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert is given new weapons by Rebekah to help him channel his power. Rebekah tells him that mastery is when he's able to call up Timothy.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was early in the morning when Robert would have to wake up for another training session in Castlerock. Today, he would be training with Rebekah. He ate breakfast and headed out to the private airship that would take him to the training facility. 
Once he got there, he was led back into the warehouse he had been training at. Rebekah was waiting for him. 
Something was different when he walked in. She smiled, standing behind a large table with advanced weapons assorted on it: explosives, guns of various sizes, gadgets, goggles and some kind of wrist worn device.
She called out, “Just in time, Bob! Come over here!”
Robert wondered what was going on as he approached Rebekah at the table. He was very surprised she was being so nice to him considering what went down in the meeting.
“Like what you see?” she asked.
Robert picked up one of the rifles. It was a beautiful work of futuristic art and felt comfortable in his hands. The barrel was three times the size of an assault rifle’s.
“Wow, this is nice,” Robert said. “What kind of ammo does this thing take?”
“Your magic,” Rebekah answered, grinning.
Robert was confused. “Come again?”
Rebekah came around the table and handed Robert his magic amplifying gloves. 
“Your magic powers every one of these weapons you see here. Your magic is amplified through your gloves and channeled into these weapons. They have very powerful effects depending on the strength of your magic. That includes the explosives too, by the way,” she said, indicating the grenades laying on the table.
She then picked up another rifle identical to the one Robert was holding in his hands.
“You see this?” she asked, showing him the shiny surface on the back of the pistol grip, which was a different material from the rest of the rifle.
“Yeah, looks like chrome,” Robert said.
“Put those gloves on,” she said.
Robert obeyed, putting the rifle back on the table and putting the gloves on.
Rebekah picked up the wrist device. “Put this on one of your wrists. It doesn’t matter which one.”
Robert was lost, but he put the wrist device on.
Rebekah removed the Crystal that was hanging around Robert’s neck, unlatched a small opening on the wrist device, slipped it inside, shut the opening and pressed a button. The wrist device’s little lights lit up to a soft red glow. Robert’s hands suddenly felt warm. He looked at them. 
“Alright, take your rifle and hold it, making sure you’re holding onto the pistol grip.”
Robert picked up the rifle and held it the way Rebekah was showing him.
A dummy was rolled out in front of him about 50 feet away.
“Alright, Robert. Take aim and fire at the target the way you would fire any other rifle. But you’ve got to focus. It’s your magic that will be channeled through the rifle.”
Robert aimed, pulled the trigger and the rifle blasted. Before he knew it, the dummy was charred and melted, burning in flames. 
Robert was blown away by what he just did so much that he almost dropped his weapon. He barely managed to even hit a dummy his first couple of days of training and now has just destroyed one with one shot.
“See what I’m talking about now, Robert?” she asked.
“That was incredible!” Robert exclaimed.
Two more dummies were rolled out, this time 80 feet away. Robert fired off at them. They were both burning to a crisp within seconds.
Robert gushed, “Oh man, I think we hit a breakthrough!”
Robert thought back to the sizable weapons stockpile he and Tiffany packed before leaving Earth. Surely he should have known the Rulose was going to provide him with higher grade weapons if they brought him all the way to this planet to be a top soldier. Earth’s weapons were junk compared to this. 
Rebekah nodded. “You’re a long way from reaching the full extent of your powers though, Robert.”
“I heard,” he said. “I was told that the pinnacle of mastery will be when I’m able to summon a literal god from the Spirit World. In this case, Father Quelatune believes it will be Timothy.”
“He’s right,” Rebekah said. “But as for right now, it’s time for phase two.”</Text>

            <Title>Tiffany repremanded</Title>
            <Synopsis>Rebekah, hot with anger at Tiffany, blames her for why her reputation is damaged and tells her that what she did was dishonorable. Tiffany apologizes but Rebekah threatens to make her life hell if she doesn't straigten up. Tiffany fires back telling her that as Head Counselor, she could demote her even further so she better watch it and that she's onto her.</Synopsis>
            <Text> Tiffany’s first day on the job as Head Counselor was fairly uneventful. There weren’t very many bills people were attempting to get passed that she needed her staff to review and anything she was asked to do was nothing more than simply signing off on things. 
Tiffany walked back into her office after lunch and got a message from the intercom.
“Tiffany speaking,” she answered.
It was the front desk receptionist on the other end. “Tiffany, Rebekah is here to see you.”
Tiffany’s stomach was immediately in knots. She knew that if she let Rebekah in, this was not going to end well. She also knew, however, that if she didn’t allow Rebekah in, she would come across as a coward to Father Quelatune as well as those who put her in this new position.
“Let her in,” she said.
“Alright, here she comes.” The receptionist hung up.
Tiffany braced herself, wondering what Rebekah could be coming in to tell her. What if Rebekah wanted to threaten her or verbally attack her? She was prepared for the worst.
At that moment, Rebekah walked in. Tiffany, trying to be as professional as she could be, said, “Hi, Rebekah. How are you?”
Rebekah pulled up a chair and sat down in front of Tiffany’s desk. “How are you liking the new job?” Rebekah asked.
“Well, it’s fine,” Tiffany answered nonchalantly. “Pretty uneventful right now.”
“Oh, it’s eventful,” Rebekah said. “It’s just that they don’t have you doing anything.”
Tiffany didn’t know how to respond to that but she already knew where this was going.
Rebekah leaned forward. Her eyes narrowed. “Tiffany, let’s get one thing straight right now. You’re not going to hang onto that position forever so do not get too comfortable. Father Quelatune made it crystal clear that position is mine as soon as all of this stuff blows over. You understand that, do you?”
Tiffany didn’t respond.
Rebekah continued. “Me being a Kwan has politically hurt me but the fact that you turn your back on me not only doesn’t surprise me, but it smacks of everything the overwhelming majority of you Earthlings are: selfish, backstabbing, despicable, sick individuals. If you think for a second that you’re getting a free ride when I get my position back you couldn’t be more wrong in your pathetic life.”
Tiffany felt a powerful combination of fear and anger hit her like a battering ram. She was genuinely scared of what Rebekah would or could do to her as soon as she got her position as Head Counselor back but she also felt a visceral anger that normally came about when somebody confronted her the way she was being confronted. 
“You pitiless, sad, incompetent, useless individual!” Rebekah said with cold hearted venom. “I will make your life so much hell and politically wipe your lilly-white face off of this planet! You have no idea what my job entails, so don’t pretend to know what the hell you’re doing ‘cause you don’t. You’re a figurehead and nothing more.”
Tiffany was dizzy with anger but was frozen, still trying to process it all. Her face was hot and her eyes burned as she fought back tears of rage.
“Cat got your tongue?” Rebekah taunted. “Of course you have nothing to say, because you know how much you do not belong here.” 
Rebekah leaned in closer, inches from Tiffany’s face. “Go home. Go back to Earth. Stay there, drink bleach and kill yourself for all I care. You’re trash. I know it, Robert knows it, Father knows it and most importantly you know it. You don’t belong on this planet and you never will.”
Tiffany had it. “Rebekah, you got one thing wrong,” she said.
“And what is that?” 
“I’m not a fucking figurehead,” Tiffany said quietly. She then raised her voice, more confident. “And if you continue to talk to me the way you are, I’ll demote you even further so you better watch it.”
Rebekah said nothing but Tiffany could see she was beginning to break her. Tiffany pressed further. “And yeah, I am onto you, and so is everyone else in this Temple. No one knew about the Kaoli Man project, but you and your little sis may be tight. Am I right about that, Rebekah?”
“Shut up, Tiffany—”
“Get out,” Tiffany said quietly, like her father said to her back on Earth the last time she spoke to him.
Rebekah chuckled with contempt. “You really don’t know what you’re—”
“I’m not going to ask you again, Rebekah.”
Rebekah paused momentarily, then stood up, her face hot with anger. She walked out and slammed the door hard behind her.
Tiffany’s body and nerves were taut. Her pounding heart had to be beating at least 165 beats per minute. She felt like a tornado was wreaking havoc in the pit of her stomach. She leaned back and sighed, letting all the tension flow out of her body which was in an ice cold sweat. She closed her eyes as a hot tear streamed down her right cheek. Her temples pounded. She finally stood up to Rebekah and felt more confident in herself, more confident than she had felt since arriving. She was strong now. She was confident. She was Robert.
Deep down, she knew this position was only temporary but that didn’t matter. She knew that while she would probably never gain Rebekah’s approval again, she would always have Rebekah’s respect. And at the end of the day, that’s what mattered to her the most.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Rebekah is moved down to being the assistant secretary of arms/aviation defense under Amaga. Quelatune says this could be a fresh start.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Because Tiffany was now the Head Counselor, she would have to live and work in the Head Counselor’s quarters, meaning that Rebekah would have to move out. It took less than a day for her to get settled in but she would miss living with Robert. 
Father Quelatune also met with Rebekah in his office to let her know what her job was going to be until they could get things straightened out.
“I’ve decided that I’m creating a new department for you, Rebekah,” Quelatune said.
Rebekah sat up, defiant. “I thought you said this was temporary.”
“It is.”
“Then why would you create a new department just for me?”
“We’ll replace you as soon as you get your old job back,” Quelatune said. He then went into his drawer, pulled out a thick Manila envelope and laid it in front of her on his desk. “You’re going to be our Chief Technology Officer for the Rulose Air Force.”
“Snazzy,” Rebekah said sarcastically. 
“Not only will you be in charge of everything technology-related regarding our Air Force, but you’re also going to be overseeing the development of weapons that will allow Robert to channel his new powers.” 
“I’m impressed.”
“Yeah. And the only person I trust to handle running that department for the time being is you. So can I trust you, Rebekah?”
“Sure you can.”
“Good. Now, you’re going to be reporting to Amaga since she’s the Secretary of Defense and you two know each other. She’ll basically be your boss. You cool with that?”
“Not really, but I can deal.”
“Something else,” Quelatune said.
“What’s that?”
“You’ll have to move back to Castlerock since that’s where the base is.”
“Are you kidding!?”
“It’s only temporary, Rebekah. We’ll help you move and everything, but don’t you have a house out there anyway?”
“Yes I do, but I didn’t plan on moving, Father.”
“Like I said, this is only temporary until we can get to the bottom of what brought along the attack.”
“You said that ten thousand times already, Father.”
Quelatune paused momentarily, then said, “I think this can be a fresh start for you.”
“I don’t need a fresh start. I didn’t do anything.”
“You know what I’m talking about, Rebekah.” 
Rebekah shifted in her seat, obviously uncomfortable.
“When do I start?” she asked.
“You’ll start today. We’re in the process of setting up an office for you right now as we speak.”
“I can’t believe this,” she said under her breath.
“I understand,” Quelatune responded gently. “But I think you’ll find this job rewarding.”
Rebekah rolled her eyes and sighed. “Whatever.”</Text>

            <Text>After the meeting was adjourned, Smoke, who said nothing during the entire thing, stood in the hallway. Robert went over to him.
“You didn’t say anything throughout the entire meeting. What’s up?”
“I think people are jumping to conclusions,” Smoke said. “There’s no evidence that Rebekah had anything to do with what happened. She has a right to be angry.”
“Nobody is blaming Rebekah just yet,” Robert said. “She’s just being demoted temporarily because Quelatune wants to pacify her political opponents.”
“So this is all a game then, huh?” Smoke asked, almost expecting to be disappointed.
“Unfortunately, it kind of is,” Robert said.
Smoke was an idealist and Robert could tell. Unfortunately, like on Earth, politics was no place for idealism. 
“Just remember, Smoke. She’s still going to be getting paid the same as what she’s getting paid now. She’s just being asked to lay low for a while, probably until all this blows over. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of speculation within the Council surrounding her, and if Quelatune can tell them that they’re investigating her and even suspending her temporarily, that might prevent them from outing her as a Kwan to the public.”
“Yeah, but her trustworthiness shouldn’t be questioned over something she might not have even done,” Smoke said.
“I agree, Smoke.  But unfortunately, life isn’t always fair.”
Smoke sighed, understanding. “That’s true no matter what planet you’re on.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Father Quelatune seems suspicious of Rebekah. He revokes her status as Head Counselor. He assigns the role to Tiffany.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“So what now then, huh?” she asked.
Quelatune paused for a moment, then said, “Rebekah, I’m afraid, and I stress that it’s only temporary, you will be relieved of your duties as Head Counselor for the time being.”
Everyone in the room reacted with quiet shock. Horror and dismay flashed across Rebekah’s face.
“Father, no,” she pleaded.
“Rebekah, I want to make it clear that this is only temporary until we get to the bottom of this.”
“That’s not fair! I didn’t do anything!”
“I’m not saying you did, but I have to do this” Quelatune said. “We’ll find a new position for you. Your pay grade will be the exact same as what it is now. I’m only doing this because unfortunately, most people in here are suspicious, so I have to do something.”
Rebekah looked at Robert. “This is all your fault.” She then looked at Tiffany. “And I knew I should have trusted my very first instinct about you, you self-serving wretch. You have done nothing but cause trouble and division since you’ve stepped foot on this planet. Bringing you here was a huge mistake.”
Tiffany looked away.
“You sure as hell sound guilty to me,” Robert said.
“That’s enough,” Quelatune said. He then referred to Tiffany, “Tiffany, in the meantime, I would like for you to be Head Counselor. You’re a citizen so I am able to appoint you.”
Rebekah’s eyes widened. “Wh, what!? This is an outrage! Tiffany has no experience!”
“And neither did you when I appointed you.” Quelatune said. “Like I said, Rebekah, I will still pay you what you are being paid now. You’re not in trouble. But if the Council sees that I’ve done this, they are less likely to take matters into their own hands and try to out you to the public that you’re a Kwan. I’m doing this for your own good.”
Rebekah got up from her seat and started to head out of the room. “Excuse me.”
The door slammed behind her. Everyone was still quiet.
“I’m really sorry about all this, Father,” Tiffany said.
“You have nothing to be sorry about. You’re Head Counselor now. Don’t worry about being ill-prepared. There’s not much going on right now outside of trying to rebuild two floors of the Temple. However, somebody has to be in position to fill the role.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Quelatune has no idea how Riptide learned of the Kaoli man project. A mole? Rebekah is demoted as suspicion surrounds her.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next day, everyone was allowed back into the Temple. They were already working round-the-clock on repairing the two floors of the Temple that were bombed.
Father Quelatune held a meeting in the boardroom of the Rulose Temple which was down the hall from his living quarters. The boardroom had many windows as the daylight poured in and presented a stunning view of the futuristic cityscape of Angelina. Top members of the Rulose Council as well as Father Quelatune’s cabinet were present, including Amaga, Smoke, Tiffany, Robert, Rebekah and the Senior Counselor, Tyros, head of the House of Ambassadors which is the lower house of the Council (the Senate, headed by the Head Counselor, Rebekah, is the upper house). 
“I think all of you know why we are here today,” Father Quelatune said at the head of the table. “It is quite obvious that the Kwans have learned about the Kaoli Man project and we are going to get to the bottom of how they found out.”
There was a brief silence as everyone looked around at each other. Robert studied Rebekah’s features, wanting to see if there was any hint of guilt. He found none. Her expression wasn’t any different than anyone else’s.
“The public had no knowledge of this project, so somebody in the Temple leaked this information,” Father Quelatune said. “Unfortunately, we are going to have to perform interrogations on many members of the Council, as well as individuals who work in the Temple. Try not to take these interrogations personally, but our national security has been put at enormous risk.”
Quelatune then addressed Robert. “Robert, you are not to leave the Temple until we figure this out. You are also going to be under strict surveillance.”
“Father, are you suggesting that I’m a suspect?” Robert asked.
“Listen Son, right now, everybody’s a suspect,” Quelatune said.
“You gotta be kidding me!” Robert exclaimed. “The Kaoli Man project was performed on me! That would make me the last person to ever tell the Kwans about it! Everybody in this room knows Rebekah is the primary suspect!”
Rebekah’s expression quickly changed as everyone in the room gasped. She glared at Robert with absolute rage.
“Come on!” he continued. “The girl is literally Queen Riptide’s sister! It makes all the sense in the world for her to do this! If she can show enough loyalty to the Kwans, they won’t execute her in the chance we lose this war!”
“We’re not going to lose this war.” Quelatune said defensively.
“It doesn’t matter what you think, Father,” Robert responded. He then pointed at Rebekah. “It matters what she thinks.”
Rebekah bolted up from her seat. “That’s enough, Robert! You’re completely out of line!” She then looked over at Tiffany. “What do you think, Tiffany?”
Tiffany said nothing.
“Do you believe him?” Rebekah pressed.
Tiffany sighed and shook her head. Her face was white and her eyes bloodshot. She said, “Rebekah, honestly,  who else would know other than those of us in this building? And if it’s not you, who would it be?” 
“You gotta be kidding me,” Rebekah said, hatred and anger boiling in her voice.
Quelatune said, “Rebekah, perhaps you should—”
“Shut up, Father!” Rebekah screamed. Everyone jumped with surprise. Tyros put his hand over his mouth in shock as half the people in the room were slack-jawed. 
“You never trusted me!” she exclaimed. “This is complete made up propaganda these two are spreading! I haven’t spoken to my sister in ages! She wouldn’t believe anything I said anyway!”
“Is it true that the Kwans are building a weapon?” Amaga asked Rebekah interrogatively.
Rebekah threw her hands up in frustration. “How the hell am I supposed to know!?”
“We have good evidence that they are,” Amaga said. “My brother hacked into their workforce records and found a ton of evidence that they were building something. Can you tell us about that?”
Robert liked this. Now everybody was onto Rebekah. It just made too much sense not to think she was a suspect and he was glad the rest of the people in the boardroom were seeing things his way.
“You people are pathetic,” Rebekah said. “You know I know nothing about anything they’re doing!” She then turned to Quelatune. “Speak up, Father! You appointed me for a reason! Tell them how loyal I am!”
Quelatune sighed and rubbed his temples. “Rebekah, I believe you. I do,” he said quietly. Robert sensed that he didn’t believe her though.
“But it’s pretty obvious we have a mole,” he said.
“And of course, it just has to be me!” Rebekah said. “How convenient! Because I’m a Kwan, right!?”
“That’s not what I said, Rebekah,” Quelatune said.
“So what now then, huh?” she asked.
Quelatune paused for a moment, then said, “Rebekah, I’m afraid, and I stress that it’s only temporary, you will be relieved of your duties as Head Counselor for the time being.”
Everyone in the room reacted with quiet shock. Horror and dismay flashed across Rebekah’s face.
“Father, no,” she pleaded.

            <Text>“I trusted her,” Tiffany said with quiet contempt while sitting in her hotel bed, hair tied, wearing pajama shorts and a Washington Redskins jersey.
“Let’s not jump to conclusions, Tiff,” Robert said. “You told me not to do that last time, remember?”
“Nobody knew about the Kaoli Man except for the Council, Bob! Word never got out. It sure as hell wouldn’t have gotten out to the Kwans. There’s no question there’s a mole. She’s a Kwan! She’s freaking Riptide’s older sister, for crying out loud! Who else could it be!?”
Robert thought back to Rebekah’s baby boy, Skyler, and how precious he was. He felt more of a need to give Rebekah the benefit of the doubt this time than he did before.
“Maybe we need to talk to Amaga, Smoke or Father Quelatune first,” Robert said. “Maybe they know something we don’t.”
“Bob, nobody is here but us. You don’t have to pretend you don’t find this compelling.”
Deep down, Robert knew something wasn’t right. The more he thought about how this was all pointing to Rebekah and the loyalty she might still have to the Kwans and her sister, the more he became suspicious. This was especially the case if his theory had any weight to it in that Rebekah was trying to prevent herself from being executed just in case the Rulose lost this war by showing loyalty to the Kwans through treacherous actions. </Text>

While this was an improvement over the first day of training, as far as being of any use in combat is concerned, his magic was still a long way off. They also tried magic amplifying gloves the Defense Department had been working on. While these gloves made it easier as far as keeping fireballs from dissipating before they had a chance to reach their targets, they did nothing to assist in Robert’s accuracy. Nonetheless, he, Tiffany and Amaga did the best they could to stay positive.
The three of them decided to take a load off and joined Smoke for a night out on the town. They went to a comedy show at a club very close to the Temple, only about a block away. They later went out for dinner at a restaurant called Luloa, which was across the street from the Temple. The food was expensive but the portions were huge. Amaga didn’t eat that much only because she was saving room for desert. 
The waitress laid a large cheesecake in front of her. Robert and Tiffany were surprised as this was the first food since coming to Rulose Island they recognized from Earth other than the imitation food they were served on the airship and in the Temple.
As soon as Amaga was about to dig in, there was a sudden panic all around them in the restaurant. People scattered all around the crowded dining hall. Screams rang out. Servers ran about as people bumped into each other. Robert, Tiffany, Amaga and Smoke suddenly stood up and looked around. Outside, they saw crowds of people running for their lives.
“What the hell is going on!?” Robert cried out.
“Outside! Something is going on out there!” Amaga said.
They ran outside and stared in horror as a large cloud of smoke covered the upper stories of the Temple across the street and billowed out into the night sky. 
“One of the floors of the Temple is on fire!” Robert said.
“That’s way too much smoke for a normal fire. That floor has been bombed!” Smoke said.
“Which floor is it!?” Tiffany asked.
“I can’t tell from here!” Amaga said.
Boooooooom!!! Another explosion on another floor right below the floor that was on fire startled the already panicked citizens and caused Robert and the others to jump in shock. A fresh cloud of smoke floated out from the flame-lit shattered windows. 
Amaga punched a button on her watch. “Father! Amaga here! Can you hear me!? Father! Father!?” She punched another button on her watch. “Rebekah! This is Amaga, can you hear me!? Rebekah! Rebekah!” She turned back to Robert and the gang. “Nothing!” 
Was this an assassination attempt? Robert didn’t want to think the worst but the four of them started toward the Temple as many others were fleeing from it. As Robert and the crew got closer, they could hear the blaring alarm from the Temple with its emergency exit doors wide open. Heavily armed soldiers were guiding helpless Council members, government aides and Temple staff out of the building. The avenue nearby was completely blocked off and filled with a sea of panicked citizens. An aircraft hovered overhead. Robert looked up and saw through the windows of the aircraft the pilot, Father Quelatune, an individual they didn’t know and Rebekah.
Amaga ran up to one of the soldiers directing traffic. “Hey! Why weren’t any of us notified of this!?”
“Our communications were all shut off!” the soldier responded. 
Amaga gasped. “Impossible!”
“I don’t know how it happened either! But nobody’s intercoms work!”
Tiffany asked, “Are the Kwans responsible for this!?”
“Definitely,” the soldier said.
Robert asked, “Which floors got bombed?”
“The medical facility where they treated you,” the soldier responded.

Everyone was told they had to stay the night in hotels. No one was allowed back into the Temple for the next two days. The Burgundy Guard, overseen by Amaga, combed the entire Temple for more explosives into the wee hours of the morning two nights straight and didn’t find anything else. The explosives used were typical explosives you’d find in any Kwan armory so this was no doubt a terrorist attack by the Kwans. They specifically targeted the two floors that were designated for Robert’s Kaoli Man operation and post-op recovery. Every other area of the Temple remained completely untouched. Even the elevator still functioned properly, but the two floors designated for the Kaoli Man project were completely destroyed. The Kaoli Man project was a top secret project. There was no way the Kwans would have known about it but it was now obvious they did. But how?</Text>

            <Synopsis>Smoke and Amaga recollect about their past. We go back to when they led one of the biggest slave exoduses in history. The idea, though, is that the exodus campaign they led might have started the war, which is why most members of the counsel like them but the public doesn't. They also tell Robert about how they're ramping up on slave labor because they're building something in Amelrak but they don't know what it is.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Smoke came by the apartment later. He and Amaga shared stories about what life was like as slaves. Seeing them together was heartwarming. They were very close, laughing and completing each other’s sentences. Their friendship reminded Robert very much of his friendship with Tiffany. During their conversation, Amaga brought up something interesting.
“The Kwans are now starting to ramp up on slave labor. They’re bringing more people into their slave camps and they’ve built two new factories.”
“What for?” Robert asked.
“They’re building something. What, I have no idea,” Amaga said. “All I know is that my brother and his team hacked into the Kwans’ workforce management database and found that their weapons and defense department laborers have been working substantially more hours than normal. That, along with the fact that they’re building two factories and bringing all of these new slaves in leads us to believe they’re building some kind of weapon.”</Text>

            <Title>Robert meets Amaga</Title>
            <Synopsis>Amaga is the older sister of Smoke. She is the Secretary of Defense. Robert asks Amaga about how easy it is for Lemor-Ixa to hack into the controls. She says that due to the fact that boxes have to be able to communicate with Mission Control from such far distances, security has to be sacrificed. The Kwans knew they were coming because of the landing signal they were able to detect. This makes Robert feel better.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tiffany and Robert waited in their living room. It would only be a few more minutes until Amaga was scheduled to arrive. Tiffany was fixing tea on the stove. Neither of them had ever drank tea from another planet but they were about to try it. 
Tiffany poured a cup and took a sip. It was still hot but it was good. She poured Robert a cup and he liked it too.
There was then a knock at the door.
“That must be her,” she said as she walked over to the door and opened it. They were met by a tall, drop dead gorgeous young black woman with very dark skin, a fit, slender physique and a short fro. 
“You must be Amaga,” Tiffany said.
Amaga smiled. “That’s right. May I come in?”
Tiffany invited her in. Robert nor Tiffany even knew this woman but the way she walked into their living room indicated she had a strong presence that commanded respect.
“Have a seat,” Robert said as Amaga sat down next to them. She smelled nice, too. Robert was kind of smitten.
“So my brother Smoke is coming down here in a little bit,” she said. “Is that OK?”
“Sure, Smoke is cool,” Tiffany said.
Amaga cleared her throat. “So Father Quelatune said that you guys wanted to arrange a meeting with me.” 
Robert asked, “Did he tell you why?”
“I got bits and pieces. I take it you’re under the impression that Rebekah might be conspiring against us.”
Tiffany said, “There’s just concerns that we have, that’s all.”
“I understand. Does this have anything to do with her being a Kwan?”
“A little bit,” Robert said. “On our way to this planet, we were attacked by Kwan hostiles in the Desert of Illusion.”
Amaga laughed. “Why yes, you were landing in a war zone on their home turf, Robert.”
“But how did they know we were gonna be there? We were way out in space when they started showing up. Not only that, but Lemor-Ixa hijacked our box’s controls. How was she able to do that? It all just seems too convenient.”
“First of all, the boxes that we use for space travel have to be able to communicate from very far distances with Mission Control.”
“Sure.”
“So, because they have to be able to communicate with Mission Control from so far away, security from system hijacking has to be sacrificed. We just simply don’t have the technology, at least not yet, to implement heavy-handed defense from system hijacking with boxes because of how far they get from our planet yet still have to be able to communicate with Mission Control. The problem is that you guys had to land in Kwan territory so a landing signal was sent down to that area and that’s how the Kwans were able to detect you. It didn’t have anything to do with Rebekah. Anything Rebekah would have done in that box would have been recorded by Mission Control. Every keystroke of the controls inside every box we have as well as every ship we have is recorded and logged. If Rebekah pulled something treacherous, we’d have record of it. Father Quelatune and I checked all of her control data from that day right before I arrived here tonight and there was no record of any wrongdoing.”
Amaga’s explanation was succinct, to the point and satisfactory for Robert. Maybe he was overreacting. He felt bad about blaming Rebekah but on the other hand, he was just being cautious. There’s nothing wrong with that.
“Listen, Amaga, I’m glad you explained everything,” Robert said. “I was just a little bit concerned, that’s all.”
She smiled. “I understand. So Robert, how’s your recovery going?”
“It was tough at first but I’m feeling a lot better. You have any idea on exactly what kind of powers I’m gonna have?”
Amaga smiled and shook her head. “I have no idea.”
“So you’re the head of all military operations here, huh?”
“That would be me.”
“You also designed the X1?”
She nodded, “I sure did.”
“The X1 is such an amazing ship,” Tiffany said.
Amaga turned to Tiffany. “Thank you, Tiff.”
Robert said, “The word on the street is that you’re the only pilot in this country Father Quelatune has seen whose better than I am.”
She smiled. “If you’re up for a little contest on the flight sim, I’m down.”
“Wait,” Robert said. “If you’re the head of the defense department, that would basically make you my boss, right?”
She laughed. “Not exactly. You’re not a government official. You’re not even a citizen of this country. You’re not from this planet, remember?”
They both laughed. She was so amazingly beautiful and smart, Robert thought to himself.</Text>

            <Title>Robert meets Smoke</Title>
            <Synopsis>Quelatune takes them on a tour of the Temple to get Robert back in good spirits. They finally meet Marxis at Mission Control and they meet Amaga's brother Smoke, a master hacker and Director of Intelligence. Robert is suspicious of Rebekah and grills Smoke on her as he assumes Smoke would have dirt on her. This makes Tiffany uncomfortable. He asks how the Kwans knew they were going to be landing in the Desert of Illusion. Robert grills Smoke but he doesn't know any more and refers him to his sister Amaga.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After about three and a half weeks, Robert began to report that he was feeling better and the dizziness had gone. He was able to find the strength to start going out again but he still had to report to the medical facility every afternoon and go to bed every night in their sleep study room.
“When is this gonna end?” he whined one morning while still in bed hooked up to all kinds of monitors and machines.
Tiffany was sitting in a chair next to him. He had just woken up and the medical staff was fixing him breakfast. She took his hand as she fingered the plastic wristband that had his name and date of birth on it.
“You’re making it, Bob. I know this is tough. Just realize that you’re living your dream right now,” she said.
Robert closed his eyes, still tired. “I hope this is all worth it. I really do, Tiff.”
Robert wondered when he was actually going to start being able to use his new powers. He wondered what kind of powers he would have. He was always a big fan of comic book heroes who had magical powers. He also remembered watching Disney’s Fantasia as a child and thought it was so cool how Micky Mouse was able to, as a magician, make mops and water buckets dance. He was so fascinated with the possibility of having such abilities, or so strung out on the medications and the sleep aid they were giving him to cope with all the side effects of the operation, that he asked Father Quelatune if he would be able to clean his apartment by making mops, buckets and bottles of all-purpose cleaner move about just by the mere gesture of his hands.
“Probably not,” Father Quelatune said with a gentle smile.
Dammit.

Father Quelatune took Robert and Tiffany on a tour of the Rulose Temple to help raise Robert’s spirits.
They visited Mission Control which consisted of the Network Station, a large room of several people working at advanced computer stations similar to NASA’s Mission Control, and the War Room, a large, sprawling hi-tech room of military strategists working on various projects on large tables of advanced computers and large screens. The head of Mission Control was Marxis, who assisted Robert and Tiffany on their trip from Earth. They were glad they finally got to meet him in person and thanked him again for all his help.
They visited the Intelligence Center which was not actually in the the main building of the Rulose Temple, but was in a very large separate building that could be reached by going down the elevator of the main building and taking a subway. There, they met Smoke, a tall, handsome bearded jet-black brother, master hacker and Director of Rulose Intelligence. Smoke, along with his older sister, Amaga, were not only human slave refugees but were human slave abolitionists. A few months after the cease-fire, they hijacked two Kwan slave ships in Amelrak, the Kwan Empire’s capital and largest city, and were able to safely bring 300 slaves to Rulose Island. Many Rulatians applauded their act of bravery but many Rulatians and members of the Council felt like it put the country at risk for retaliation by the Kwans. Father Quelatune appointed both Smoke and Amaga as members of his Cabinet. Many members of the Council were very much against this, but many others in the Temple took a liking to them. Smoke became particularly close to Rebekah’s son, Skyler, often babysitting him when Rebekah was busy.
Robert and Tiffany wanted to get to know Smoke more as they were impressed by he and his sister’s heroic deeds. They met up with him at The Raindrop for lunch.
“It’s really an honor to meet you guys,” Smoke said as the waitress laid large plates of fresh Pondrel, beans and rice before Tiffany and Robert. Robert quickly said grace and ate.
“We heard about what you guys did. Robert and I were both really impressed by it. What was life like as a slave?” Tiffany asked.
Smoke sighed, reminiscing. “The Kwans aren’t all bad people. A lot of the government leadership and the slaves’ taskmasters were, but the general population of Kwans are just normal people trying to survive. We were able to hijack those slave ships because one of the Kwan mechanics cut off the security systems for us. Most Kwans despise Queen Riptide and hate the fact that humans are being used as slaves.”
“You’re the head of Intelligence, right?” Robert asked.
“Yes, that would be me,” Smoke answered.
“That means you not only know about what’s going on outside of the country and what the Kwan Empire’s plans are, but also about what secret projects are going on within this government, right?”
Smoke eyed Robert suspiciously. “What exactly are you really asking of me, Robert?”
“Smoke, these people did a surgical operation on me after going all the way to Earth to come get me. We then, on our way back, end up getting ambushed by Kwan militants in the desert. How in the world did the Kwans know we were coming? How did the Kwans know we would end up having to land in the Desert of Illusion even though we were originally supposed to land here in Angelina?”
“Uh, Robert—”
“Then I find out from Tiffany that Rebekah is a Kwan.”
Tiffany interrupted. “Wait a minute, Bob. I think you may be grasping at straws here.”
Robert turned to Tiffany who was sitting next to him. “You don’t find it a little too convenient?”
“Look,” Smoke said. “Rebekah’s not—”
“How easy is it to hack into a box?” Robert asked.
“What?”
“Lemor-Ixa hacked into the box. We were on our way back and had to do an emergency landing in the Desert of Illusion. Somehow, their general, Lemor-Ixa, was able to hack into the box and take over the controls. I asked Rebekah specifically if something like that had ever happened before and she said it hasn’t. Then she blamed Tiffany for why this all occurred, possibly to take the blame off herself.”
“You’re being really presumptive, Bob,” Tiffany said.
“OK,” Robert said flatly with a shrug. “Father Quelatune didn’t even tell me or Tiffany about this Kaoli Man operation prior to the meeting in the Grand Hall.”
Smoke seemed a bit surprised. “Really?”
“Yes, really. I don’t know exactly what’s going on, but I’m gonna get to the bottom of it. Something doesn’t feel right about all this. I understand you’re really close to Rebekah’s baby boy and so you don’t want to believe anything bad about her, but—”
Smoke said, “Maybe you ought to talk to my sister and see what she has to say.”
“Maybe you ought to answer my questions,” Robert said.
“Robert—” Tiffany pleaded.
“You’re a hacker,” Robert said to Smoke, not even looking at Tiffany. “Tell me how easy it is to hack into a box and take over its controls.”
“My sister Amaga would know that better than me,” Smoke said. “You’d have to ask her. She’s a lot more familiar with the Kwans’ military operations and capabilities than I am. If they hijacked the controls of the box, that was something their military did, not their intelligence. It’s not like they spread around a computer virus that shut down Mission Control’s network. That would be something I could talk to you about. I’m not gonna be able to tell you about them taking over the box’s controls. And no, I’ve never heard of them being able to do that before.”
Robert nodded, never taking his eyes off Smoke. He simply chewed his food, not saying anything else.</Text>

            <Title>Robert's operation</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert undergoes the Kaoli Man project. He's taking pills, having to undergo medical checkups and sleep studies every day that last for hours and eventually starts throwing up from the medication he's taking. Tiffany at one point worries this may kill him but the doctors continue to tell him he will be OK.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next morning, Robert visited the doctor at the medical facility in the Temple for his checkup. They went through the routine procedures such as checking his blood pressure among other things, which was no different from what was done on Earth. The doctor also checked Robert’s life energy levels which was obviously a very different procedure from what was done on Earth. It turned out that his life energy levels were normal. 
Robert was then told how his procedure was going to go. There would be a small incision right around his solar plexus. There would then be a large machine that would be placed around the bottom part of his heart. His heart rate would be slowed down to about 30 beats per minute as life energy would be slowly extracted from his body into a shard of Kaolium. The goal was to sap as much life energy from Robert as possible without killing him before removing the machine from his heart. The lost life energy would be replaced by the life energy of donors (most donors of life energy were euthanasia patients, but some were criminals who were sentenced to capital punishment). The operation would only take about two hours and he would be able to go home after 3 days.
Robert was prescribed medication that he would have to take or die as a result of the operation. The medication was prescribed to prevent the genetic mutation found in humans that caused their nervous systems to shut down during the original Kaoli Man project. Robert would have to take the pill every day for the next 3 months. Being told he would die if he didn’t take these pills scared him a little. He would have to start taking them a week before the operation and three months after. The pills gave him mild headaches but luckily, the medical staff gave him pain relievers.
The day of the operation, Tiffany was by his side. The operation was said to be a success but when Robert woke up from the surgery, he felt very dizzy. The doctors told him he would feel dizzy for the next two weeks. Robert didn’t like that at all.
He was sent home but still felt bad. Every time he stood up, he felt like the room was spinning. Tiffany was worried but the physicians would come by every afternoon, take him in a wheelchair up the elevator to the medical facility to perform a full body PET scan, MRI scan and a physical, send him back home to his apartment, tell him he was fine and that this was all just a normal part of the recovery process. Their daily checkups took four hours every day and  were an absolute nightmare. According to them, Robert’s brain was simply still telling the rest of his nervous system to shut down due to the genetic mutation but the genetic mutation didn’t affect him because of the pills he was taking. 
He was not allowed to sleep in his own bed either. He had a scheduled bedtime he was held to every night. He would be hooked up to all kinds of monitors in a makeshift bedroom, given his pills to take, the lights would go out and they would literally watch him while he was sleeping. It sucked but at least the bed was comfortable.
Robert was for the most part free to do whatever he wanted in the mornings but he felt so miserable he hardly ever left the Temple. He didn’t lose his appetite but it began to become difficult to keep food down as he started vomiting on a somewhat regular basis, on average once every other day. Tiffany worried constantly that Robert was surely dying from this project, but the doctors stressed that he was actually doing much better than they expected him to do. They animal tested this operation several times and the test subjects all did worse than he was doing at the point he was at in his recovery but they all turned out fine in the end, so this was good news. Robert and Tiffany wondered how all those animals they tested didn’t just say “screw it” and killed themselves. 
Things got pretty serious one morning when Tiffany came home to the Temple to see Robert passed out on the floor. She immediately called for help and he was rushed to the medical facility within minutes. Everything turned out to be fine. He was just dehydrated. They injected him with intravenous fluids afterwords, he felt better and was sent back home to the apartment. Father Quelatune yelled at Tiffany for leaving as she was expressly told that Robert was never to be alone during his recovery.</Text>

            <Text>“I don’t know how the family is going to feel about this, Tiff,” Lauren said over the phone while Tiffany was in the nursery giving Michael a bath.
“I’m honestly more worried about you than Michael. You know I’ll be glad to take care of him while you’re gone. But you’re going to another galaxy. You realize you may never return, do you?”
“You have no idea how much I realize that, Lauren,” Tiffany said.
Robert put his arm around Tiffany to comfort her while she was tending to Michael.
“You coming by here tomorrow then?” Lauren asked.
“Yeah.”

That night, Tiffany and Robert read stories to Michael for what might be the last time. The next day they took the long drive out of town to Lauren and her husband Henry’s home to hand her son over to them. Letting her son go was extremely difficult for Tiffany. That night, she cried in Robert’s arms and eventually fell asleep on the couch. She knew Michael would be in good hands but it was still hard.</Text>

            <Text>That was the easy part. Now it was time for the hard part: facing the parents.

Tiffany and Robert pulled up to a double-wide trailer in the outskirts of Richmond. 
Tiffany cut the car off and sighed. “Here we go.” 
Tiffany’s decision was all over the news so it wasn’t like her parents didn’t know what was going on. This, however, would be the first time she would sit face to face with them and hear what it was they had to say. Lauren warned Tiffany that the conversation was going to be difficult.

Robert and Tiffany walked inside. Tiffany’s parents looked nothing like her. Robert was almost taken aback.
Her mother, Susan, was very thin and despite being 62, looked much older than that. Her father, Rick, was hardscrabble and scowling the minute they walked in.
Tiffany and Robert sat down on the couch across from them. They said nothing. There was an awkward silence for what felt like an eternity.
Tiffany broke the silence. “So, I just want to get you guys’ thoughts on everything.” 
Her mother leaned back, not taking her eyes off of her daughter, then said, “Well honestly, I—”
At that moment, there was a knock at the door. They looked outside and saw Lauren’s car.
“Did you bring her here?” Susan asked.
Tiffany and Robert shook their heads.
“Rick, get the door.”
Rick got up, opened the door and invited Lauren in.
“Lauren, it’s good to see you but what are you doing here?” Susan asked. 
Lauren walked in past Rick, ignoring her mother. She made a beeline over to Tiffany.
“Tiffany, Bob, I fully support your decision no matter what, OK?” she said in an almost exasperated tone.
“Lauren, hush!” Rick said loudly. This silenced everyone in the room.
Lauren nervously sat down next to Robert and Tiffany.
Robert has been in and has seen some of the most extreme combat situations any soldier would ever see, but Tiffany’s dad scared the hell out of him.  
“You wanna go off on an adventure with your little boyfriend, that’s fine. But you’re neglecting your son in the process and I don’t think that’s right,” he said. 
Lauren hopped up from her seat. “Dad, I told Tiffany that we were fine with taking care of Michael—”
“Lauren, stop making excuses for her!” Susan interrupted. “It isn’t your job to be a mother to him and it sure as hell isn’t ours!”  
“You weren’t a mother to me either, so what does it matter?” Tiffany said under her breath. Robert felt even more uncomfortable.
“You keep taking the low road, Tiff. You very well may end up dead,” her mother said.
“Is that a warning or wishful thinking?” Tiffany asked.
“Tiffany, please,” Lauren cautioned. 
Tiffany was going to be gone on another planet but it would be Lauren who would be having to deal with the day-to-day wrath of Mom and Dad.
Tiffany took Robert’s hand, still facing her parents. “The point is that Bob needs me.” 
“Your son needs you,” Susan said.
Rick then directed his attention to Robert. “Aren’t you supposed to be a war hero!? Aren’t you supposed to be good at this stuff!?”
Robert’s trepidation was now turning into anger. Very few people have actually questioned his fortitude or skills as a soldier.
Robert averted his gaze. “I’m not getting into this with you.”
“You’re in our house. You’re going to show us some respect,” Susan said.
Tiffany buried her head in her hands. “This is not going well.”
“You’ve got the news, the feds, and all of society following my daughter around day and night! What do you have to say about that!?” Susan asked. “Look at me!”
Robert had enough. “Listen, guys,” he said. “I’m going to try to be as respectful as I can be here, OK? If you two actually talked to Tiffany and knew her as well as you claim you do—”
“Excuse you!?” Susan interrupted.
“I’m not finished,” Robert said. 
Robert was a drill instructor once upon a time while serving in the Army so he could project in a way that would shake somebody up quick, and that’s what he did here.
“If you guys knew Tiffany as well as you claim you did, you would know that she loves her son more than life itself. You would never question how much she cared for him and the fact that the two of you would even think about doing so says a lot. This is complicated. This is a difficult decision but I can guarantee you that Michael was the first person Tiffany thought about when making her decision. If there’s truly an extra-terrestrial threat out there that can take over a planet more advanced than ours, what’s going to stop them from taking over this planet in due time? If there’s anything we can do about that, I think we should.”
That felt good but her parents weren’t happy at all.
Rick leaned back and glared at Tiffany. “Get out.” 
“What…?” Tiffany asked in disbelief.
“All three of you. Get out of here,” he said.
“That’s it, huh? We’re not going to discuss this further?” Tiffany asked, hoping there was some way to save this.
Rick got up from his seat. “Listen up. You made the decision without our consent, told the whole world before consulting with us and now you come in here and expect for us to just give you our blessing!? It doesn’t work that way! And then your jarhead friend comes into this house and disrespects us both, knowing that he’s the one that got you into this mess!” 
“Fighting for our country,” Tiffany interjected. “And he’s not a ‘jarhead’. He was in the Army, not the Marines.” 
“I don’t care if he was the President of the United States! He’s corrupting you!” Rick said.
Robert shut his eyes and sighed. Tiffany saw he was getting agitated and hated her parents for it. She took Robert and Lauren by the hands and led them up from the couch. “I think for once, I’m going to do as I’m told and leave. Let’s go, guys.” 
All three of them headed out of the house.</Text>

            <Text>The car ride back home was mostly quiet. The sun was setting and the next morning, Quelatune would be returning to them privately for their departure. 
“I’m so, so sorry about all of that earlier,” Tiffany said, ashamed.
“Don’t be. You didn’t do anything wrong,” Robert said.
Several moments passed and  neither of them said another word.
“Listen, Tiff, you can still back out of this if you want. The last thing I want is for you and your family to be split over this.”
Tiffany chuckled. “That ship sailed a long time ago, Bob. I appreciate the concern, really, but I actually want to do this even more than I did before.”
Robert was surprised to hear that.
“I was reminded back there why I was never all that close to them. Not one time did they even show an ounce of concern for my safety or well-being. The only thing they were concerned about was how terrible of a mother I was and then they tried to send me on a guilt trip.”
Robert sensed the anger and frustration in her voice and took her by the hand. “Let’s try to get our minds off of that and enjoy tonight, OK?”
She sighed and nodded.

The two of them ordered pizza, watched a movie and cuddled on the couch together. It was at that moment it hit them both that they were really going to go through with this.
“Are you scared?” Robert asked.
“Are you?” Tiffany asked right back.
Robert was pretty anxious only because he didn’t know what to expect. 
What if this was a trap? What if there was some kind of malfunction with the box they were going to be traveling in and they wound up getting lost in space forever? How long would  it even take to get to this other planet? There were so many questions neither of them had the answers to but the biggest was: would Father Quelatune accept Tiffany going with Robert to this other planet or would all of their plans be dashed?
Whether they liked it or not, all of those questions were going to be be answered in the morning.</Text>

            <Title>In the woods</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany and Bob go into the woods to meet with Quelatune and Rebecca</Synopsis>
            <Text>It would later be time for them to head out into the woods hoping that Quelatune would find them. The key was to go somewhere that no reporters or news crews would be able to access, so they arranged for the feds to escort them to a private location. The feds were going to be showing up within a few hours. 
It was 5 AM by the time the two of them finished packing. They sat in the living room of Tiffany’s house eating breakfast for what could be the last time they ever ate food from Earth. 
By 6 AM, three armored SUV’s pulled up to their house and they were escorted out. To where? Who knows. Why two other SUV’s were needed? Tiffany nor Robert were told. The FBI agents sat next to them in the vehicle they were being escorted in. Neither said a word to Robert or Tiffany.
All three SUV’s veered off of the road and down a dirt trail in the woods. They had no idea what was going on but no one, not the driver, the FBI agent in the passenger seat or the two FBI agents sitting next to them said anything. 
The three SUV’s pulled up to a large clearing in the woods where they were met by an Apache attack helicopter and two other SUV’s. Heavily armed men with rifles were present. Robert felt a little nervous. One of the agents, almost sensing Robert’s apprehension said to him, “They’re here for your protection”.
All three SUV’s parked in the clearing. It was 6:45 AM, 15 minutes before Father Quelatune was set to arrive. They were not allowed to leave the vehicle.
Fifteen minutes later, the two SUV’s in front of them opened their doors and out came more heavily armed men with rifles, surveying the sky. 
“Tiffany, look!” Robert whispered, pointing up at the trees beginning to wave from heavy wind.
They looked up into the sky and the clouds started moving just like they did before in Paris.
“He’s right on time,” Tiffany said to herself.
The wind began to blow even harder. Faintly in the sky, an object could be seen. Sure enough, it was a box similar to what Quelatune came down in last time. As the box descended, they could see that this one was much larger than the one before, presumably because they would be taking Robert along with them. Tiffany hoped they would allow her to join him.
The box landed gently on the ground in the clearing and the wind stopped blowing. This particular box had sliding double-doors. Out came Quelatune and Rebekah, but they were dressed differently than before. They were in what resembled gray flight suits. One of the armed men went over to Robert and Tiffany’s SUV, opened the door and escorted them out. Two others brought their luggage to them. Everyone turned to face Quelatune and Rebekah who stood before them.</Text>

            <Title>Tiffany is joining</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany and Bob tell Quelatune that Tiffany will be joining. Rebekah and Quelatune deliberate and grant access.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“You made it,” Quelatune said. “I see that you’ve packed, so that must mean you have made the decision to join us, yes?” 
“On one condition,” Robert said, nodding toward Tiffany. “I’m going to need Tiffany here to join me.”
Quelatune seemed a bit surprised by this. He and Rebekah looked at each other and back at Robert.
Quelatune then said, “Robert, the reason we only wanted to bring one person was because we don’t want for the people of our country to know we’re here. As I said, this trip to Earth was extremely unpopular with the citizens of our country but we felt it was a necessary decision.” 
“Yeah. This is a top-secret assignment that we’re on,” Rebekah added. “Bringing somebody else along makes it more difficult for us to keep it that way. We simply can’t bring somebody else if it isn’t necessary. I’m sorry.”
Tiffany’s face fell. 
Robert felt like now was the time to speak up. “Look, guys,” he said. “You all have been doing this info-gathering on me for quite some time, so you should be aware that I would be useless to you by myself. I can provide you with my expertise, I can provide you with my experience, but I know what my limitations are. I was suicidal, I constantly still suffer from flashbacks and I don’t know how I’m going to be at my best all alone on another planet. Tiffany has a six month old son that she’s leaving behind to join me here because she knows how much I need her by my side. If Tiffany doesn’t come with me, I might as well not even go. That’s how much of a necessity she is.” 
“Excuse me for one moment,” Quelatune said. He and Rebekah walked back inside of the box and the double doors shut behind them. Tiffany and Robert waited. None of the armed men said a word or moved. They all stood and waited for what felt like several minutes.

Quelatune knew he had a big dilemma on his hands. It was already difficult enough for him to convince the Council to bring one person from Earth for this project. If he came back with two, his political opponents would blame him for presidential over-reach. They would say that he was taking advantage of his power. If he only allowed Robert to come, he was far more likely to return home empty-handed because Robert would decline. He knew that nobody else from Earth would be allowed to go through with this mission if Robert wasn’t willing to, so picking somebody else was out of the question. It was either show up with two people, which would be bad for him politically or show up with no one which would be even worse for him politically. He knew what he had to do.

The double-doors re-opened. Father Quelatune and Rebekah came back out. Robert and Tiffany looked at each other and nodded.
“Tiffany, if Robert needs you, we would like for you to join us,” Quelatune said.
Robert and Tiffany sighed with relief.
The double doors opened again as Quelatune nodded to the guards. Two of them walked with Tiffany and Robert as they stepped inside the box and the double-doors shut behind them.</Text>

            <Title>Called Gaia</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany and Bob ask what the planet is called. There isn't a name for the planet. But the Kwans call it Gaia.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Inside the box was beautiful. It looked like a cozy and comfortable bungalow, soft lighting, large white couches, gray walls, a refrigerator, cream-colored carpet and a large and advanced station of controls and monitors over on one side of the room. Robert and Tiffany were surprised by how Earth-like it was.
“Make yourselves at home, guys. We picked our Earth-iest model,” Quelatune said as Rebekah took command of the controls. 
Robert and Tiffany sat down. The couch was very comfortable. There was a rumbling they could feel under the floor.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! The engine purred.
“What was that?” Robert asked looking around.
Quelatune smiled. “We’re leaving.”
“We’re up in the sky now, Father,” Rebekah said.
Robert saw on one of the monitors the helicopter that was in the woods level with them in the sky, rising with them.
“Hey, they’re following us up,” Tiffany said.
“Seems like it,” Quelatune said. “They probably just want to make sure we’re not going to do something to you guys. We’ll end up passing them soon enough.” He turned to Robert. “Robert, how high can those things go?”
“That’s an Apache,” Robert answered. “It can fly up to a little over 9,400 feet.” 
“We’re approaching 3,200 feet now, Father,” Rebekah said. The helicopter continued to ascend alongside them.
“So what is your planet called?” Tiffany asked Father Quelatune who sat down on the couch next to them.
“4,500 feet now, Father,” Rebekah called out. The helicopter was still going up with them.
“We don’t have a name for our planet. We just call it ‘the planet’, but the Kwans call our planet ‘Gaia’ so I guess that’s what you can call it,” Quelatune said.
Robert looked around the room. “How does this thing even work?” 
“Once we are in space, we open up a portal, taking a shortcut through space-time to our planet.” 
“A space-time shortcut?” Tiffany asked with curiosity.
“That’s right,” Quelatune said. “We use a highly concentrated energy wave combined with an electrical current to open up a space-time portal.”
“5,500 feet now, Father. The helicopter is still following us up,” Rebekah said.
“What kind of energy?” Robert asked.
“Energy that comes from Kaolium charged with nuclear fusion energy,” Quelatune said.
“What’s Kaolium?” Tiffany asked.
“Kaolium is an element that exists on our planet that is able to absorb infinite amounts of energy,” Quelatune said. “In order to open up a space-time portal, you need to concentrate an incredible amount of energy into a very small point in space the size of an atom. If that sounds dangerous to you, it isn’t, at least not for us inside of this box. But before we open up the portal, we have to be very far from Earth because we don’t want anything from your planet, whether it be satellites or even aircraft that may be flying around in your skies to suddenly get sucked into the portal and stuck inside.”
“How far from Earth are you guys going to get before opening the portal?” Robert asked.
“At least 500 miles. That will be roughly three hours once we leave Earth’s atmosphere. Once the portal is open, it will be about another hour before we touch down on our planet. So that’s about a four hour trip.” Quelatune then smiled. “That’s why I said to make yourselves at home.” 
“8,000 feet now, Father. The chopper is still following us,” Rebekah said.
“It won’t be long now before it will no longer be able to,” Robert said. “They probably just want to make sure you guys don’t pull something.”
Quelatune laughed. He had a gentle demeanor. Robert and Tiffany liked him.
Rebekah then said, “Alright, it seems like the chopper is descending now. We’re at 9000 feet.”
Robert could see the helicopter no longer following them up and slowly coming out of view. He smiled. “Looks like we’re all alone now.”</Text>

            <Title>Quelatune gets to know Bob and Tiff</Title>
            <Synopsis>They head on out as the trip is roughly four hours.</Synopsis>
            <Text>They eventually found themselves in space after about 15 minutes. 
Despite being in zero gravity, it didn’t feel that way inside of the box.
“Centrifugal force,” Quelatune said. “That’s what keeps us on the ground even in zero gravity.” 

Once they made their way far enough from Earth, it was time to open the portal.
“Alright, here we go, Father,” Rebekah said.
“Cover your ears, guys. This is gonna get pretty loud,” Quelatune said.
Rebekah and Quelatune both covered their ears with their fingers as did Robert and Tiffany.
A few seconds later, whooooooooooooooosh!
The whole room jolted twice.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
The engine under the floor purred loudly.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
The engine purred even louder.
The whole room jolted for a third time.
Ding, a gentle bell-like sound similar to the sound on an airplane when altitude has been reached sounded.
Quelatune nodded and uncovered his ears. Rebekah did the same as did Robert and Tiffany. 
Quelatune smiled. “That was fun, wasn’t it?”
Robert laughed. “That was wild!” 
“It should be smooth sailing from here, guys,” Rebekah said from the controls.

Quelatune was able to tell Robert and Tiffany all about the war between the Kwans and the Rulose, the cease-fire and the attack on Candel Village. Rebekah introduced herself, sat down next to them and talked since the box was on autopilot until they would have to land. 
Quelatune did not feel like it was the right time to tell them about the Kaoli Man project. He and Rebekah decided to wait until they got home before dropping that bombshell on them.
Robert and Tiffany seemed like really nice and genuine people. Father Quelatune was afraid that Earthlings would be hostile toward them. Earth’s countries are constantly in conflict with one another and the people on their planet are also incredibly selfish which was why they were technologically so primitive. The only news that got any attention on their broadcasts was the worst news out there. They have these things called “tabloids” that go out and look for the worst news to dredge up about any person, place or thing. When they can’t find news bad enough to pass muster for their editorials, they make stuff up. This made absolutely no sense to Father Quelatune. Why Earthlings had such an addiction to seeing other people’s misery was beyond his understanding. It was hilarious yet sad how sadomasochistic these people were. Not only that, but they seem to project this mentality onto everyone else. They assume the worst when they meet strangers and assume that anyone from another world must want to “take over their planet”. Quelatune felt somewhat guilty for thinking this, but he wondered what anyone in the universe, including the Kwans, would want with Earth and its sad, selfish, miserable people. Earth didn’t need the Kwans to drive them to extinction. They will do that to themselves. 
But Robert and Tiffany were different. Robert didn’t watch the news and only owned a television to play video games and watch movies. Tiffany was a beautiful woman. She was intelligent, loyal and curious. He liked her too. He knew he got the right people for this job.
He also knew that they were scared. He knew that they had no idea what they were in for. Less than a month ago they thought they were alone in the universe. How scary it must be for them now to know they are not.</Text>

Tiffany had two suitcases of clothes, Robert had one, but most importantly, they each had a suitcase for weapons. Robert packed an AR-15, a bolt-action rifle and two IMI Desert Eagle handguns. 
Tiffany brought with her her late husband’s AR-15 and two Beretta 92FS pistols. They also brought along his collection of hunting knives and a baseball bat. Robert also, for whatever reason, felt the need to bring a fire extinguisher. They would have brought more but their luggage was starting to get heavy.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Upon exiting the portal, they're low on feul as they didn't expect Tiffany to come with them (weight). Emergency land.</Synopsis>
            <Text>At some point Robert fell asleep. He woke up and felt Tiffany’s head resting on his shoulder. The scent of her shampoo woke him up even more. She was asleep as well and was beginning to awaken. Father Quelatune was standing over Rebekah’s shoulder at the control station. They were both wearing large headsets. There were all kinds of numbers rapidly running across one of the monitors. Maps, diagrams and other things populated the other screens. Robert couldn’t put his finger on it but he had a feeling that something wasn’t right.
“Everything alright?” Robert asked Quelatune and Rebekah while yawning. Tiffany sat up from the couch and yawned.
“Alright, what’s the reading?” Rebekah asked, eyes glued to one of the screens with a map on it along with a blinking white dot.
“Yeah. What? OK.” 
“Get Marxis back on,” Quelatune said, focused on the same screen.
“Marxis, you there? What’s the differential for this box? Uh-huh. What? Really? I told you, we’ll talk about that later. Alright.”
His voice had more tension in it than Robert felt comfortable with. What on Earth were those two talking about and why were they ignoring him?
Tiffany whispered to Robert, “What are they talking about?” 
“Everything OK over there?” Robert called out again.
“We’re working on it,” Quelatune said, almost as if he didn’t want to be bothered.
Rebekah said, her voice even more strident than Quelatune’s, “Reading’s in. Not enough, Father.” 
“Oh great,” Quelatune said with disappointment. He then pressed a button on the control deck. “Angelina, this is Father Quelatune. Can we use Aux power?”
Rebekah shook her head and whispered, “No.”
“I didn’t ask you, Rebekah!”
Rebekah threw her hands up in frustration.
“No? Dammit…”
Rebekah sighed. “I tried to tell ya—”
“Shut up!” Quelatune snapped.
He then got up from the chair and turned to Robert and Tiffany. “Look guys, we have a bit of a problem.”
Robert and Tiffany sat up.
“When they fueled for this mission, they provided just enough for…um…basically, a trip to Earth is expensive. When we landed, we didn’t know that Tiffany was coming with us. Now, Tiffany, I don’t know how much you weigh and I’m not gonna bother to ask, but your weight plus the weight of your luggage is going to make it impossible for us to land where we were meant to. That means, unless our calculations are wrong, which they probably aren’t, we’re going to have to perform an emergency landing.” 
“Oh man,” Tiffany said with a sigh. “I’m so sorry, guys.”
“Don’t blame yourself, Tiffany. Robert needs you. It’s OK. We’ll get through this together.”
Robert put his arm around her as she hang her head down. “Yeah, Tiff, it’s alright. I can’t do this mission without you.” Robert then turned his attention back to Father Quelatune. “Where are we gonna end up landing?” 
“We’re gonna end up landing in the middle of the desert,” Rebekah said from the controls.
Quelatune turned back to Rebekah. “Which one, Rebekah?” 
“The Sotorion region, it seems. The Desert of Illusion,” she said.
Quelatune’s eyes widened. “The Desert of Illusion!? Are you sure we can’t find somewhere else!?” 
Rebekah shook her head. “That’s it, I’m afraid.” 
Quelatune had an uneasy look on his face as he went back to the station and hit one of the buttons on the control deck. “Angelina, this is Father Quelatune. Please tell me that we’re not landing in the Desert of Illusion.”
Robert and Tiffany looked at each other with fear. Robert so desperately wished he knew what that meant.
“Alright, please tell me there’s nothing going on over there right now!”
He then sighed with relief. “Alright, thank God.”
He hit the button again and tossed his headset off. He put his hands on his hips and sighed with frustration. Rebekah leaned back in her chair, exhausted. Quelatune then turned back to Robert and Tiffany. “So yeah, bad news, guys. We’re gonna be landing in the Desert of Illusion. That’s not where you wanna land.”
Fear gripped Robert by the throat and didn’t let go.
“What’s the Desert of Illusion?” Tiffany asked.
“The Desert of Illusion is a former national park….right smack dab in the middle of Kwan country, right outside of Camlyn, which is home to one of the Kwans’ biggest air force bases. There’s recently been a big uprising down there between human rebels and Kwan militants. A lot of lives have been lost there over the past several months.” 
Robert’s heart pounded out of his chest. Tiffany was just as scared.
“You’re giving me a heart attack, Father Quelatune. Please tell me I have nothing to worry about,” Robert said.
Quelatune sighed and shook his head. “I wish I could, Robert. That being said, though, we’ve been getting reports on the situation down there right now and nothing is going on. Hopefully it stays that way but with the Desert of Illusion, that can turn on a dime…”
Robert buried his head in his hands and Tiffany did the same. They were both overwhelmed. Not only were they not going to be landing in Angelina like they were supposed to be, but they were going to be landing in Kwan country right outside one of their largest military bases and on top of that, in a war zone. 

Yeah, this was not good.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Tiffany feels bad about putting them in danger. Robert and Quelatune comforts her. Rebekah is not as forgiving.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Back in the cockpit, Tiffany sat down in one of the seats and hang her head down. Robert walked over to her.
“You were amazing, Bob,” she said quietly. 
Robert sat down next to her and placed his hand on her knee. “What’s the matter?”
She shook her head. “This is all my fault—”
“Stop,” Robert insisted. “We need you here. All of that we went through, if that was what it took for us to have you here, it was worth it.”
Rebekah and Quelatune walked over to them. 
“Are you alright, Tiffany?” Quelatune asked.
Tiffany sighed. “I just feel kind of bad because none of this would have happened if it wasn’t for me.”
“It’s not like what you say is false,” Rebekah said.
“Rebekah, not now,” Quelatune said.
But Rebekah didn’t let up. “I’m just stating the truth. Listen, Tiffany, I don’t know you so don’t take this personally, but we can’t have you in your feelings throughout this entire campaign. Remember, you weren’t even supposed to be here anyway so you need to make yourself a little bit more useful than you’ve made yourself.”
“That’s enough, Rebekah,” Quelatune said, his voice rising. 
Rebekah knew to stop but glared at Tiffany with contempt. Tiffany felt Rebekah’s icy stare and lowered her eyes.
Rebekah glanced at her watch. “Help should be arriving. We’ll be out of here soon enough.” She walked back over to Cypher who was still at the control desk.
“I’m really sorry, guys,” Tiffany said.
“Nothing to be sorry about, Tiffany,” Quelatune said. “Don’t worry about Rebekah.” He went back over to the others.
Tiffany got up. “I need some time to be alone.”
Robert looked up at her with concern. “Tiff, are you sure you’re OK?”
“I really just need to be alone right now. I’ll be back. Please don’t follow me,” she said.

Tiffany made her way down the hallway and back into the box which was now just a room in the X1. She sat down on the couch. All the monitors were off and it was completely quiet. She untied her hair and it fell down at her shoulders. She had a pounding headache. She took out a bottle of water and some Advil from her purse and downed two tablets. She was drained both mentally and emotionally.
She followed Robert to this strange planet because she thought he needed her. It turned out she only got in his way. She was now convinced coming here was a mistake. Not one time did he suffer from a flashback. Not one time did she have to assist him. Why the hell should they go through all of this trouble just to keep her there? She so desperately wanted to go back to Earth, not because she was scared, but because she could not deal with the guilt of getting in Robert or anyone else’s way again. She knew that leaving wasn’t possible, however. Asking to go home would not only make her look weaker than she already looked, but it would be a huge inconvenience for everyone. Father Quelatune said that they went through a lot of trouble to bring them to this planet and that it wasn’t popular with his constituents. Robert proved his worth as she knew he would. Father Quelatune, Rebekah, Marxis and Cypher have now embraced him as one of their own. She knew that they still viewed her as an outsider, an inferior Earthling.</Text>

            <Title>Help Arrives, Tiffany/Rebekah</Title>
            <Synopsis>A rescue craft comes along. Robert and Tiffany almost kiss. Rebekah is cold to Tiffany but Robert takes up for her.</Synopsis>
            <Text>They waited in the X1 for hours on the airship that was to come and take them back to Rulose Island. Everyone was hungry and tired. 
Finally, the airship arrived. Quelatune, Tiffany and Rebekah said their goodbyes to Cypher, thanked him for the X1 and boarded the airship. It was small and very modest compared to the X1, no larger than a private jet. The interior was nice with comfortable couches, but most of all, food. 
Robert and Tiffany were surprised when the servant laid before them an elegant silver platter covered with a lid. When they lifted the lid, they found burgers and fries with bottles of carbonated beverage that tasted like a cheap imitation of Coca-Cola. It was cute how the Rulose tried so hard to accommodate Earthlings as they later learned that their cooks put quite a bit of time into preparing their food. The ingredients were not from Earth, so while the food was pretty good, it tasted like alien cuisine trying to imitate Earth food. The meat came from a large beast called a Calipher. Caliphers somewhat resemble Rhinos but have long tails. The lettuce was similar to Earth but had a lighter taste. The bread was essentially the same but the cheese came from the milk of a flying reptile called a Bender, which looks like a Pterodactyl. Tiffany and Robert both wondered how in the world milk could come from a reptile. Last time they checked, milk only came from mammals. Perhaps this planet was stranger than they thought. Who cares? The cheese was damn good! The fries were pretty much the same because one of the few edible plants that Earth had in common with Gaia were potatoes. The fries were cooked in Calipher fat. Robert and Tiffany inhaled the food and finished off the drinks.
Full, they both sat down together on one of the couches while Rebekah and Father Quelatune were up front in the cockpit with the pilots.
“How are you feeling?” Robert asked.
Tiffany smiled meekly. “I’m really proud of you, Bob. These people love you already.”
“You know I need you here, right, Tiff?”
Tiffany didn’t really believe him. She shrugged, looking down. “Yeah, you’ve said that a few times.”
“Tiffany, look at me,” Robert said. She turned to him. Her ocean blue eyes sparkled as if she were about to cry. Robert caressed her cheek. She took his hand and held it up against her face. The warmth of her skin and softness of her hair took him over. Their faces moved closer and closer as the flames grew hotter and hotter until—
“Tiffany.”
Robert and Tiffany looked up from the couch to see Rebekah standing over them.
“Rebekah, hi,” Tiffany said nervously.
“You mind if I sit down?” Rebekah asked. They gave Rebekah a space on the couch between the two of them.
She turned to Tiffany. “Listen, Tiffany. I want you to know that I didn’t mean anything personal by what I said to you earlier. I need to make that very clear. I have a job to do.”
Tiffany nodded and swallowed hard. “I understand that, Rebekah.”
“Understand that Robert came here to do a job as well. You understand that, do you, Tiffany?”
“Of course I do.”
Robert didn’t like where this was going but he didn’t say anything just yet.
“I honestly am not even sure why he brought you here,” Rebekah said. “But if Robert wanted you here, we didn’t have any other choice but to respect that. Just know that the only reason you are here is because we wanted him so badly.”
Robert interrupted. “Rebekah, what is your point!?”
She ignored him and continued to address Tiffany. “I strongly suggest you understand your place.”
“And what is that, Rebekah?” Tiffany asked defiantly.
“I hope you know that Father Quelatune is furious that you are here,” Rebekah said. “He wishes more than anything we could send you home. But we know that if we were to do that, we’d lose Robert.”
Tiffany was gutted to hear about this. “Did he tell you that, Rebekah?”
“I’ve known him for five years, Tiffany, he doesn’t have to tell me. I’m not here to sugarcoat things or make you feel better. I’m here to tell you the truth.”
“Rebekah, cut this out, OK!?” Robert said.
Rebekah sighed and turned to him. “Love has no place on the battlefield, Robert.”
Robert tried to hold back laughing at her. “You really want to talk to me about battle, Rebekah? I’m a soldier. Tell me, how many battles have you been in?”
“Robert, I—”
“You wanna know who else is a soldier!?” Robert nodded over to Tiffany. “Tiffany! She’s a world class emergency room physician, a US Air Force Major! That’s a higher rank than I was in the Army! Now do you honestly think that her medical experience wouldn’t be useful!?”
Rebekah rolled her eyes. “We already have doctors. We don’t need people from Earth who aren’t even as good—”
“And I’m pretty sure you didn’t think our pilots were as good as yours either, huh?” Robert asked.
Rebekah had nothing to say in response to that. She sighed and looked away.
“That’s what I thought,” Robert said.
Robert took Tiffany’s hand.
“Look at her,” Rebekah said looking at Tiffany with contempt. “She’s a mess. Ditch her.”
“What’s your problem?” Tiffany asked.
“I don’t have a problem,” Rebekah answered defensively. 
“Rebekah, I sense a problem,” Tiffany said.
Rebekah, completely emotionless, got up and started to walk away, but turned and said, “We’re not continuing this conversation.”</Text>

            <Title>Robert, Tiffany and The Council</Title>
            <Synopsis>Father Quelatune introdues to the Council Robert and Tiffany. He puts Tiffany over strong. He also mentions Robert undergoing surgery for the Kaoli Man project. Robert is furious he's just now hearing about this.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The blue screen on the television suddenly changed and Father Quelatune appeared. Robert and Tiffany glanced at each other and back at him on the screen.
“Good morning, guys. Did you sleep well?” Quelatune asked.
Tiffany smiled. “Good morning. We did, Father.”
“Good. An aide is going to be down there shortly. I need you guys to come to the Grand Hall. You’re going to be introduced to the Council.”
This made both Robert and Tiffany extremely nervous. They knew Rebekah was the leader of the Council’s Senate, which would mean she probably had quite a bit of influence on the Council’s opinion. What if she put a bad word in about Tiffany? What if she went all around the Council and said that Robert was the only person that should have come and that Tiffany only got in the way and caused them to have to perform an emergency landing in the Desert of Illusion? Robert then thought about how unpopular with the Council Father Quelatune visiting Earth for one person was. He didn’t even want to imagine how much more difficult politically it was going to be for him since he actually brought two back.
“Father, can I ask you something?” Tiffany asked. “Am I gonna get any kind of chance to prove myself to them? Rebekah’s the Head Counselor and already has it out for me.”
Quelatune nodded, understanding. “I promise I’ll go to bat for you, Tiffany. Don’t worry about Rebekah.”

The aide came by and handed Robert and Tiffany ceremonial robes as it was customary to wear them during meetings in the Grand Hall. They were then taken up the elevator and an hour later, were sitting before the 200 member Council in the gorgeous meeting hall. They were up on stage, the two of them, sitting in chairs over to the side while Quelatune was at the podium giving his speech. Rebekah was sitting behind him.
“These two brave souls dropped everything to come to this planet to help us. They didn’t come here because they had to. They didn’t come here because it was popular on their home planet to come here because it wasn’t. They came here because they cared about humanity.”
The Council applauded.
Quelatune then gestured over to Tiffany. “We originally visited Earth just for Robert, but Robert insisted that we bring this young lady along with him because he knew how qualified she was and he knew that the same drive, the same passion that convinced him to take this journey was the same one that compelled her to leave her six-month old son at home to help her fellow man, even light years away. 
“She showed how qualified she was as it was her quick thinking that saved not only my life, but the lives of all four of us who were on board the shuttle from Earth to come here.
“You see, something terrible and awful happened on our way here to this planet yesterday. Queen Riptide’s highest ranking general, Lemor-Ixa, somehow was able to hijack our shuttle’s controls and threatened to cause us to crash land into the planet. Our communications department has begun work to make sure that this is never able to happen again, but it was Tiffany who suggested that we cut off Lemor-Ixa’s communications with our shuttle and merge with the X1. 
“Not only were we able to neutralize the threat of the hostile militants Lemor-Ixa had waiting for us once we made our descent in the X1, but we were also able to land safely. I know that going to Earth and bringing Robert here wasn’t popular with many of my friends here in the Council so I’m pretty sure that bringing Robert along with somebody else isn’t any better. However, considering the contributions Tiffany has made already, I think we should give her our respect and our gratitude.”
The Council applauded again. Tiffany looked out of the corner of her eye to see Rebekah’s reaction. Miraculously, Rebekah applauded just like everyone else.
“It is now time that we get to the big issue, and that is the Kaoli Man project. Robert will be undergoing this brand new and unprecedented operation that will save millions of lives. Once the operation is complete, he will be capable of far more than he ever thought was possible and will possess powers the likes of which no one ever even knew existed. We are all so excited about this opportunity.”
Robert and Tiffany looked at each other and shrugged. They didn’t remember Father Quelatune telling them about this.
“We hope to start soon. Over the past month, two whole floors of this Temple have been turned into a medical facility that was specifically designed for this ambitious procedure as well as Robert’s subsequent recovery. The operation will be performed by two of Rulose Island’s top surgeons and the three month rehab will be overseen by our world class medical staff here at the Temple 24/7. We will closely monitor Robert’s learning to use and control his new powers as well as his physical and mental recovery. We promise to keep all of you on top of everything that will be going on throughout this groundbreaking project
..
“Robert is no doubt special indeed. He will solidify that as he will be the very first in history to undergo this new operation which will give us the edge we need to finally bring justice to Queen Riptide. It isn’t just Rulose Island, however; the fate of the entire world rests upon the success of this operation and the incredible powers Robert will possess as a result.”
Robert was shocked, confused and….wait…what!? An operation!? Magical powers!? He and Tiffany were both dumbfounded and flabbergasted. Father Quelatune nor Rebekah ever said anything about Robert undergoing a surgical operation. Was this what they brought him here for? So that he could be a guinea pig for a potentially dangerous experiment!? Robert went from being shocked to being furious. He wanted to jump out of that chair and strangle Father Quelatune to death. He wanted to go home but now felt trapped on this planet! His heart raced and beat out of his chest. Father Quelatune was just using and manipulating him the entire time. Quelatune knew that had he told Robert and Tiffany about this Kaoli Man project, there was a chance Robert would have declined. He knew he couldn’t trust him! It was a miracle Robert didn’t get up and show his whole ass in front of that Council, told them all to kiss it, slapped the taste out of Father Quelatune’s mouth and said Hellz to tha’  NO!</Text>

Tiffany is deeply upset she doesn't get to go through with it abd wants to be alone.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Father Quelatune finished his speech and everyone was dismissed. There was then the usual post-meeting chaos of Council members socializing with each other in the meeting hall and many of them wanting to talk to him and Rebekah. 
Quelatune searched for Robert and Tiffany but couldn’t find them anywhere. Did they leave? 
He went over to Rebekah who was talking with two councilmen. 
He had to shout over all the chaos as if he were at a nightclub on the dance floor. “Rebekah, have you seen Robert or Tiffany!?” 
Tiffany shook her head.
Quelatune continued to weave his way through the throngs of councilmen and blew people off who wanted to chat with him, asking them if they had seen Robert and Tiffany. 
“I saw them leave right after the speech was over,” one of the councilmen said.
Quelatune began to feel regret for not dropping the bombshell of the Kaoli Man project on Robert earlier. He worried about how Robert was going to take the news. The fact that he left so early was not a good sign that he took it well. 
Whatever qualms Robert had about the Kaoli Man project, and Quelatune was sure there were many, he hoped to have them handled soon because Robert did have the choice to leave the planet and go home if he wanted to. Robert was not a Rulose citizen so he could not be hired as a government contractor. This was literally going to be an act of good will on Robert’s part if he was going to go through with this.
Quelatune made his way out of the Grand Hall and headed quietly down the hallway to the Receptions desk on the same floor. He approached the receptionist. She was, of course, surprised and a bit intimidated that the President of Rulose Island was speaking to her directly.
“Mr. President,” she said with reverence.
“Hi. Have you seen Robert or Tiffany walk past here?”
“Yeah. They headed to the elevator. I think they were going down.”
“Down?”
“Yeah. Definitely down.”
“They must have been headed to the lobby, right?”
“I would imagine. They were both walking really fast, especially Robert.”
This didn’t sound good. It seemed like Robert and Tiffany were quickly trying to leave to avoid talking to him. He hoped they weren’t going to other Council members and complaining to them about this or even worse, going to the press because that would be a political disaster. All he knew was that he needed to speak with them as soon as possible.
Quelatune later checked their apartment and they were not there. He made his way back to his office. Rebekah came up to see him.
“Father, we can bring them back here by force if we want,” Rebekah said.
Quelatune shook his head. “No we can’t, that’s ridiculous. That’s not going to make Robert want to go through with this.”
“You don’t have any idea where they went?”
“No I don’t, Rebekah.” He then leaned forward, glaring at her. “Whatever issues you and Tiffany have with each other is your business, but the way you’re talking to her, cut it out.”
Rebekah rolled her eyes dismissively. “I don’t have a problem with her, Father, so don’t give me crap for being up front with her.”
“You realize she’s the key to Robert going through with this, do you?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Convince her that Robert should go through with this and you’ve probably convinced him.”
“And what makes you think she’ll try to convince him to go through with this?” Rebekah asked. “What makes you think she doesn’t feel the same way he does?”
Quelatune leaned back in his chair. He was tired, stressed out and exhausted. “Listen, Rebekah. I need you to look for them. I need you to find them. I need you to talk to Tiffany and work out whatever differences the two of you have and I need for Tiffany to try to convince Robert to go through with this operation. There’s a lot riding on this.”
Rebekah glanced at her watch. “I’ll do the best I can, Father.”

Robert and Tiffany needed to get out of the Temple for a while. They went back to The Raindrop for lunch. They ordered the same thing they ordered the night before. 
Robert shoved a forkful of Pondrel and beans into his mouth, chewed and swallowed. “They say the recovery is three months! Three months, Tiffany!”
“Yeah, Bob. But all you can do is tell them that you refuse. Just know that there is a possibility you’ll get sent back to Earth if you do.”
“I didn’t say I was gonna refuse,” Robert said.
“You’re going through with it?” Tiffany asked. 
Robert said nothing.
Tiffany pressed him further. “Bob, are you doing this or not?”
“Tiffany, I don’t know!” 
Tiffany paused, taken aback.
Robert shook his head. “Sorry, Tiff.”
“It’s alright, Bob.”
“I guess….I don’t know, I just need some more info on this,” he said.
“You wanna go back to the Temple after we finish?”
Robert was silent again. He stared off into space.
“Bob?”
Robert sighed, shaking. “I’m just…tired of the lies and the traveling and the…I just wanna be left alone and I’m sick of the stress and constantly being taken for a ride and all of the crap and everything in between and the dealing with people saying one thing then doing the other and I just, I just, I just, I just—”
“Bob, calm down,” Tiffany said, knowing that Robert was on the verge of a flashback.
“I just, I just, I, uh, um, I, uh—”
“Bob—”
Robert’s breathing got heavy and he dropped his fork.
“Them…..cutting…them cutting me open and….” he whispered breathlessly.
“Bob—”
Tiffany held onto him and massaged his shoulders, trying to calm him down. He was shaking, hunched over and breathing heavily. People were looking at him in the restaurant.
“He’s alright,” she called out.
Robert was trying to breath deeply and slowly. He was hunched over and had his eyes closed. Tiffany held his hand tightly.
“Focus on my voice, Bob,” she said quietly. “Everything’s OK. You’re safe here. You’re safe here. You’re super safe here.”
Robert’s breathing slowed as he nodded, his eyes still closed.
“Safe. Safe,” he whispered. Onlookers were still concerned. Thankfully he was coming back. He eventually calmed down and opened his eyes.
“You OK?” she asked gently.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he said softly. “I wanna go back to the Temple, but I don’t wanna speak to anybody when I get there.”

Tiffany and Robert paid for their meal and decided to take their food to-go. They took a shuttle back to the Temple and made their way up the elevator back to their apartment. Robert went to the TV and unplugged it to prevent Quelatune from showing up even when it was turned off. He didn’t want to speak to anyone at the moment. He went into his bedroom, shut the door, turned off the lights and plopped down on the bed. His muscles relaxed. Laying on his back in the dark on the soft bed made him realize he was so much more exhausted than he thought he was. He closed his eyes and it wasn’t long before he fell asleep.

Tiffany was in the living room reading a book she got from the Temple library. There was a buzz at the door. She looked through the peephole and saw that it was Rebekah. She immediately braced herself.
She opened the door. “Uh, hi, Rebekah.”
“Tiffany, hi.”
“Listen, I know you guys are looking for Robert. He’s taking a nap right now. See, he had a flashback and—”
“Tiffany, we actually wanted to speak with you.”
A pang of fear suddenly became present in the pit of Tiffany’s stomach. Were they sending her home? Were they going to punish her? Were they kicking her out of the Temple? What was going on?
“Am I in trouble?” Tiffany asked.
“Not at all, Tiff,” Rebekah said. Tiffany was very surprised Rebekah just called her “Tiff”. Perhaps she was trying to build rapport with her?
“We just need to speak with you. It won’t take long.” Rebekah said with a smile. “Come on.”

Tiffany and Rebekah went up the elevator and eventually found themselves in Quelatune’s quarters, which was the most luxurious living quarters one could imagine.
“This place is beautiful,” Tiffany said as they made their way down the hallway to Quelatune’s office.
They made it into the office and Quelatune was talking into an intercom device. “Hey listen, I have to go. Over and out.”
He hung up.
“Hi, Tiffany,” he said as Rebekah and Tiffany sat down at his desk.
“How are you, Father?” Tiffany asked quietly.
“Tiffany, how are you feeling?” he asked.
She didn’t know whether to be honest or not. Quelatune picked up on it quickly.
“You can be honest with me, Tiffany. Nothing you say here will be used against you and nothing you say will impact your position here,” he said. 
“I understand. Honestly, Father, I haven’t been happy at all since we’ve arrived.”
Quelatune’s eyes narrowed with concern.
Tiffany continued. “I felt really bad about what happened yesterday and how it was kind of my fault we had to land in enemy territory. And then Rebekah here sent me on a guilt trip. She told me you wished you could send me back to Earth.”
Quelatune gasped. “What!? That’s not true! Did you tell her that, Rebekah?”
Rebekah nervously shifted in her seat. “Well, Father, I—”
“Did you tell her that?”
“Come on, Father. Tiffany’s exaggerating!”
“That’s exactly the words she used,” Tiffany said.
Quelatune said, “Tiffany, Rebekah is wrong. We do want you here. We know that you’re the support Robert needs in order to fulfill his mission.”
“And that mission involves a surgical operation?” Tiffany asked. “Father, why didn’t you tell us about this before?” 
Quelatune shrugged. “Listen, if I could go back in time, I probably might have. We didn’t want to scare you guys off,” he said. “We just figured you two could get settled in before we brought it up.”
Tiffany smiled. “You were afraid Robert wouldn’t go through with the mission, you’d return here empty-handed and your political opponents would use that as leverage against the President not being able to get the job done while spending an insane amount of taxpayer money to take a trip to Earth.”
Quelatune was both shocked and scared that he was dealing with a woman this sharp. She read him like a book and knew she had him where she wanted him by the look on his face.
“Yeah, we have politicians on Earth too,” Tiffany added, still grinning. 
Quelatune knew that a battle of wits was futile against this woman. 
“Listen, Tiffany,” he said. “We know the level of influence you have on Robert. We promise you this operation is completely safe. We would never risk harming him.”
“Then why couldn’t you perform the operation on somebody from this planet? Why did you have to come all the way to our planet to pick somebody out?”
Quelatune and Rebekah both looked at each other. They knew they couldn’t tell Tiffany the truth about how unpopular the Kaoli Man project was or why. Quelatune figured out a way to get around this on the fly.
“As you know, there are checks and balances in government. It’s just like it is on Earth in your country,” he said. “The fact is, nobody wants to vote on a bill to approve of this project. The reason is because the procedure involves genetic modification, and modifying genes is not popular. Despite how safe the procedure is, these people in the Council don’t want to vote on it because a lot of them are up for re-election next year.”
“Why isn’t genetic modification popular?” Tiffany asked.
“Well, in Rulose culture, a lot of people hold the belief that genes are divine and shouldn’t be tampered with.” 
“I see. So the more conservative members of your Council don’t want to vote on legislation that impedes upon the so-called sanctity of genes, correct?” Tiffany asked.
“Yes, that’s exactly it,” Quelatune said. 
Rebekah turned to Tiffany. “Can you just talk to Robert for us?”
“I’ll try to talk to him,” Tiffany said. “But he’s really upset you guys didn’t tell him about this earlier. You guys were in a tough position though so I understand why you didn’t. You were just afraid he wouldn’t come because you wouldn’t have had time to explain this all to him the way you were able to do so with me just now.”
Quelatune was relieved Tiffany was buying this because he knew he was lying. It is true that within Rulose folk culture genes are divine, but the reality is that the original Kaoli Man project was very popular with most Rulatians until it killed over three hundred soldiers. 
“One thing, Tiffany,” Quelatune said.
“What is that, Father?”
“You can’t tell anyone about this project. You have to be sworn to secrecy. The minute people know about it, we’ll have to send the two of you home. Is that understood?”
Tiffany nodded. “We won’t tell anyone.”
“Good. Thank you, Tiffany,” Rebekah said.
Tiffany stood up. “Am I dismissed?”
“Yeah, you’re dismissed,” Quelatune said.
Tiffany left.
“You think he’ll do it?” Rebekah asked.
Quelatune shook his head. “I wish I knew.”

Robert woke up from his nap and was able to think much more clearly than before.
Maybe this operation wasn’t a bad idea. There’s no way Father Quelatune would have gone all the way to Earth to find somebody to perform it on if he wasn’t confident in its success, right? 
But if the operation was such a sure thing, why couldn’t they just perform the operation on somebody from their own planet? Unless, as he suspected earlier, they weren’t sure of its safety and because the operation is going to be performed on an Earthling, if it failed and he died as a result, no Rulatian would ever know about it because nobody would even know he existed. Father Quelatune did say that this trip to Earth was extremely unpopular with the Council. But why was it? Robert had a lot of questions but didn’t want to completely rule this operation out either. He was curious about what “special powers” he would obtain. If these powers could give him an edge, why not consider undergoing it? If Father Quelatune and Rebekah flew all the way to Earth to bring him here, maybe this operation was something they felt was truly necessary.
He went into the living room and didn’t find Tiffany. She must have gone out. He looked at the TV. It was still unplugged from earlier. He went to pour some cereal that looked like Frosted Flakes but wasn’t actually Frosted Flakes at all and proceeded to eat. It tasted just like Frosted Flakes though. The imitation Earth food was pretty amazing on this planet. 
The door opened and in came Tiffany.
“Hey, Tiffany,” Robert said. He looked at her and could tell something was on her mind.
“Bob, we need to talk,” she said. She sat down on the couch and gestured for him to come over. He sat down next to her.
“Bob, I talked to Father Quelatune and Rebekah about this operation,” she said. 
Robert was shocked. Why would they talk to her but not him?
“If you want my opinion, I think you should go through with it. They assured me that it’s safe and they wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of sending us here if they weren’t sure it was.”
“But Tiffany, why didn’t they tell us about it until now? If it was a safe operation, what did they have to hide?”
“Come on, Bob, you know that if Father Quelatune would have told you that you were being sent to another planet to be operated on by aliens light years away, there’s no way you would have agreed to come here.”
“They could have at least told us yesterday on our way here. They talked about everything from the war with the Kwans, to the cease-fire to the attack on Candel Village, but nothing about an operation,” Robert said.
“I agree. Look, I don’t have all the answers, but can you at least talk to them?”
“I haven’t ruled anything out, Tiffany.” Robert got up from the couch and plugged the TV back in. He turned it on and they were met with the same blue screen they were met with before. “I wonder if there’s a way we can reach Father Quelatune with this,” he said.
Tiffany searched the remote and started mashing the “REQUEST” button, which did nothing. “I’m not sure,” she said.
She handed Robert the remote, giving up. 
Robert held down the “REQUEST” button. “Father Quelatune!? You there!?” Robert called out to the TV before releasing the “REQUEST” button. It was worth a shot, right?
Suddenly the button lit up on the remote, the TV went to a white screen and a fancy animated image of an hour glass showed up. Tiffany and Robert looked at each other, surprised.
They were then met with Father Quelatune in his office with his head turned to the side, working at his desk.
“Oh my God, Robert, it worked!” Tiffany said.
Quelatune turned to face them. “Hi guys.”
“Um, hi, Father. Do you have a minute? Robert had some questions for you about the Kaoli Man project,” Tiffany said.
“I’ll be down there in a few hours then,” he said.
The TV cut back to the blue screen.
Robert grinned. “Well, at least we know how to work the TV.”
Tiffany, curious, took the remote from Robert and held down the “REQUEST” button.
“Casablanca!” she called out while laughing.
Robert laughed as well. “Silly goose, that movie’s from Earth, there’s no way they’ll—”
Suddenly, the screen turned white again and an image of the hourglass showed up, except this time along with it was an image of the theatrical release poster for the 1942 classic film Casablanca, along with the title, director, starring cast and a brief summary of the film.
“Oh my God!” Robert said.
The hour glass turned into a set of on-screen buttons: “Watch Movie” and “Exit”.
“We’ve got some time to kill, don’t we?” Tiffany said snuggling up next to Robert as he turned on the film and the lights dimmed automatically.

A few hours later, it was late afternoon. Father Quelatune started to make his way down the elevator and into Robert and Tiffany’s apartment. 
He sat along with them on the couch.
Quelatune asked, “Robert, how are you feeling, Son?”
Robert paused before answering. “Look, Father, I’ve thought a lot about this ever since the meeting this morning. I understand why you guys didn’t say anything to Tiffany and me about this project on Earth, but why didn’t you tell us about it yesterday on our way here?”
Quelatune shook his head. “I really don’t know, Robert. I didn’t know when or how to tell you. If I could go back in time, I would have told you then. I want to apologize. I really am sorry.”
Robert could tell Father Quelatune was sincere.
“Father,” Robert said. “Can you promise me that this operation is safe? What exactly are they going to be doing to me? What are these powers I’m gonna have?” 
Quelatune nodded. “I understand you have a lot of questions, Robert, so I’m gonna try to answer them to the best of my ability.”
“Father, do you want a drink of water?” Tiffany asked.
“Thanks, Tiffany,” he said. She got up, went to the fridge and handed him a bottled water. Quelatune opened it and took a sip. 
“First of all,” he said, “we would have never gone all the way to Earth to get you if we weren’t certain of this operation’s safety. A trip to Earth is not only expensive but dangerous, as the two of you could tell. Anything could have happened to us going to or coming back from your planet. Now I’m sure you’re asking then, if this is such a safe operation why we couldn’t get one of our own people to undergo it. The reason is because we don’t want our citizens to know about this operation. The reason we don’t want them to know is because we do not have time to get their approval nor do we want to complicate this issue further via public debate. We can’t run the risk of not being able to do this just because the citizens of this country don’t think we should. Do you understand? There are some situations where the people don’t need to know what goes on behind closed doors. It’s for their benefit.”
Robert said, “I understand that, Father. Believe it or not, I do. So what exactly are you guys going to be doing to me?”
“So here’s the way this is going to work,” Father Quelatune said. “As you know, Kaolium is the greatest and most valuable natural resource known to mankind. We are the only ones we know of in the entire universe that have the knowledge of how to not only extract stored energy from it, but also the knowledge on how to transfer that energy elsewhere. 
“Kaolium energy on Rulose Island is transferred directly from the Kaoli Emerald in the Rulose Temple to a power hub about ten miles from here and from the hub to power centers all throughout the country. Those power centers power homes, vehicles, businesses, everything. When Kaoli energy is transferred from Kaolium to a piece of Carbon, like say, a lump of coal, it becomes what is known as Kaolite. Kaolite is far, far more powerful than ordinary coal and pollutes slightly less but it is no where near as powerful as energy transferred directly from the Kaoli Emerald. The Kwans use Kaolite to power their cities as well as their ships. There are Kaolite fired power plants all throughout the Kwan Empire. Kaolite was what gave us the peace treaty with the Kwans. We would give them Kaolite in exchange for them leaving us alone. Are you following so far, Son?”
“Yes I am,” Robert said.
“Here’s the important part. In order for Kaolium to be of any use, it must be stored with energy. Kaolium is able to absorb nearly infinite amounts of energy, energy of any kind, whether it be heat energy, electrical energy, nuclear energy which is what was used in the box that brought you here, or, and here’s the big one: human life energy.”
Tiffany and Robert exchanged bewildered looks.
“Human life energy?” Robert asked. “Come again?”
“Yes, Robert. What we found is that there is another form of energy that you may not be familiar with. It is a form of energy that the Kwans aren’t even familiar with. It is the energy that sustains life, the energy that powers your consciousness. It is literally the energy that sustains your soul. It is found in all forms of sentient life, in humans, animals and even the Kwans. It is the energy whose existence determines the difference between life and death. This energy is more powerful than any other energy known in the universe. The life energy of one newborn rodent, for instance, is enough to power this entire city with plenty left to spare.”
Robert and Tiffany were impressed.
“But the power isn’t the important aspect, guys,” Quelatune said. He leaned in close. “Life energy is spirit energy, and by channeling and controlling spirit energy, we can open up a conduit to the Spirit World.”
Robert and Tiffany’s mouths were open with shock.
“This is crazy,” Tiffany said.
“I’m aware this is all unbelievable to you, but the Spirit World contains forces far more powerful than what is available in the physical world. You’re at least familiar with the concept of a spiritual world, are you not?”
Robert and Tiffany glanced at each other again.
“Sure,” Robert said. “Most people on Earth believe in a spiritual world beyond physical reality, but—”
“And why do you think people believe that, Robert? Guess what, most people on this planet believe that too. We humans are innately aware of a spiritual realm even if we’ve never been shown empirical evidence of one’s existence. That is because there really is a spiritual world, and by channeling the energy your spirit provides you with to be conscious in this world, you can gain access to the Spirit World and call upon forces the likes of which no one has ever seen.”
Robert was always a spiritual and religious person, but calling upon and manipulating forces from the Spirit World seemed dangerous.
“Wouldn’t that be dangerous?” Robert asked.
Quelatune nodded. “It depends on who has such powers. In life, people’s decisions are affected by what goes on in the Spirit World. Adolf Hitler didn’t kill six million Jews on your planet fifty years ago just because. He did it because he was being led by demonic forces in the Spirit World. Queen Riptide hasn’t taken over this entire planet and enslaved a third of its population just because. She did it because she is being led by demonic forces in the Spirit World. These forces in the Spirit World can manipulate what goes on in the physical world only through people’s actions. The powers you are going to possess will allow you to unleash these powerful forces from the Spirit World. We would be no match if your intentions were evil. That is why we had to be very careful in who we picked for this operation. That being said, there are just as many forces of good in the Spirit World who are just as powerful, if not even more so, as the evil ones. You have the power to unleash these forces as well.”
Robert nor Tiffany were expecting this kind of conversation. Robert had no idea he was about to become—
“A sorcerer?” Robert asked. “Is that what you guys are trying to make me?” 
“Essentially, yes.”
Robert paused again, glanced at Tiffany and back at Father Quelatune. “What happens if I refuse?”
“The Kwans outnumber us ten to one, Robert. We need all the help we can get.”
Robert wanted to do this. He wanted to make a difference in the world, and plus, having magical powers that would allow him to conjure up forces from another dimension sounded appealing to him. He wasn’t entirely sure if this operation was safe, but he was willing to give it a try.
“You know what, Father? I’ll do it,” Robert said.
Quelatune sighed with relief. “I’m really glad to hear that, Robert. Are you sure you don’t have any other questions for me?”
Tiffany asked, “Can I undergo the operation too?”
“No you may not, Tiffany,” Quelatune said. 
“Why not?”
“Because we need you to help Robert recover. This operation costs millions of dollars per person. You weren’t originally scheduled to come here and so you weren’t allotted in the funding for it. I’m sorry.”
Tiffany didn’t respond. Quelatune got up from the couch.
“So when do I start?” Robert asked.
“We’ll let you know. I have to go,” Quelatune said on his way out. “I’m glad to see you guys got the TV working.”
Quelatune left. Tiffany was silent. 
“Tiff, you alright?”
She got up from the couch and went over to the coat rack to put her jacket on.
“Where are you going?” Robert asked.
“I’ll be back soon. I just need to take a walk,” she said.
“Tiff, I’m really sorry Quelatune didn’t let you undergo the operation.”
“It’s alright,” she said sadly. “I’ll be back soon.”
She opened up the door and shut it behind her.</Text>

            <Title>Ship takeover</Title>
            <Synopsis>The Kwans have discovered them and a quick act of diplomacy fails after Lemor-Ixa takes over control of their ship by jamming their controls. Lemor-Ixa demands that Quelatune promise to deport the slaves. Robert and Tiffany tell him to refuse. Rebekah unplugs the main communications device which will, yes, prevent their controls from being hijacked but would also prevent their ship from landing. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Things didn’t end up going as badly as they thought they would go. They ended up going much, much worse. 

45 minutes outside of Gaia, Quelatune and Rebekah began  to make adjustments for landing. It was at that moment reports from Angelina started coming in stating that the Kwans sent militants out to the Desert of Illusion with heavy-armors and mechas on the ground as well as war machines in the sky, presumably because they found out people from Rulose Island were landing there and wanted to launch a full scale attack.
“Bad news, Father,” Rebekah said. 
Quelatune, who was sitting on the couch, rose to his feet and went back over to the control station.
“Really bad news, actually,” she continued. “The Kwans know we’re coming. They’ve got hostiles on the ground and in the air in full force; war machines, heavy-armors and mechas!”
Robert and Tiffany looked at each other fearfully. Tiffany’s face was white with fear.
“Do they know that it’s us who’s landing!?” Quelatune asked.
“No they don’t,” Rebekah said. “They don’t know who it is.”
Quelatune shook his head in disbelief. “The Kwans wouldn’t dare fire at the President of Rulose Island!” 
Robert saw the blue Earth-like planet they were approaching on one of the monitor screens.
Quelatune hit a button on the control deck. “Angelina, this is Father Quelatune! Listen, we’re—”
“We’re on it, Father,” Marxis, the Mission Director at the Rulose Temple said over the radio speakers for everyone to hear. “We’re aware that the situation in the desert has completely changed. Several hostiles are in the area and are planning an attack.”
“Let the Kwans know that it’s me, Father Quelatune! They can’t possibly know that it is me who is landing because they would never fire at the President of Rulose Island! Tell them we’re coming from a mission in space and that we had to perform an emergency landing.”
“Will due, sir. We’ll try to take care of this. You’re only 45 minutes away. Unfortunately, Rulose military aid isn’t going to arrive soon enough to help you.”
“Yes, we’re aware of that, Marxis,” Rebekah said. “Who’s the most powerful Kwan you can get on the line with us?” 
“We’re still working on that. You’re gonna have to wait,” Marxis said.
Everyone in the room including Robert and Tiffany leaned back and sighed with frustration.
Hostile heavily armed alien militants running around in the desert on their own turf made Robert shudder. But as scared as he was in this moment, he felt more alive than he’s felt since his return from Mogadishu. The one thing, ironically enough, that gave him so much stress and caused him so much pain was the one thing he was addicted to more than anything else: battle. He loved the thrill of putting his life on the line, dueling with death and beating it. 
Tiffany buried her face in her hands as she quivered with fear. Robert didn’t know if she was scared or ashamed she was indirectly the cause of all this. He did not fault her at all, even if she faulted herself.
Marxis was back. “Father Quelatune, this is Marxis from Angelina again. We received intel back from the Kwans.”
“And?” Quelatune asked.
“The good news is that they have been informed that it is you.”
“OK, and—”
“The bad news is…”
“What’s the bad news, Marxis?”
“The bad news, Father, is that they don’t care.”
Everyone gasped. Quelatune was taken aback. Were the Kwans really going to try to assassinate him!? 
Marxis continued. “By order of their general, Lemor-Ixa, they are set to launch a full scale attack!” 
“Marxis, this has to be a mistake!” Quelatune said.
Rebekah shook her head. “General Lemor-Ixa has to be acting outside of Queen Riptide’s orders. Is there any way we can speak with her!?” 
“We’re still working on that,” Marxis said.
Quelatune sighed. “Do what you can, Marxis.”
“I will,” Marxis replied. “We’ll contact the—” 
There was suddenly complete static on all of the monitors. 
“What tha…? Marxis!?” Rebekah screamed. Robert and Tiffany rose to their feet and started over to Rebekah and Quelatune.
“This is General Lemor-Ixa,” a loud booming woman’s voice rang out over the speakers. Startled, everyone looked around.
“We know you’re on the ship, Father Quelatune,” the voice continued. “I think you know what we want.”
“That’s Lemor-Ixa!” Rebekah said.
Quelatune’s eyes darted every which way in panic. Beads of sweat started to form on his forehead.
“Has this ever happened before!?” Bob whispered to Rebekah. 
Rebekah quickly shook her head.
“W, what the hell are you doing!!?” Quelatune cried out.
“We’ve taken over your shuttle,” Lemor-Ixa said. “We could shut your entire system down and cause you to crash if we wanted!”
Everyone on board was in complete shock. Quelatune was speechless. He then cried out helplessly again, “Marxis! Are you still there!? If you can hear us, help!”
“Bring back every slave that sought refuge on your land,” Lemor-Ixa said. “Every man, woman and child.”
Rebekah, Tiffany and Robert shook their heads at Quelatune, indicating to him not to take Lemor-Ixa up on this.
Quelatune continued to cry out, “Marxis! Help! Somebody help!”
The lights dimmed and the ship jolted hard, so hard that Robert doubled over and bumped into Tiffany.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! 
The engine purred loudly and the floor began to vibrate. 
Rebekah gasped, tugging onto Quelatune’s arm in total panic. “Father! The ship is accelerating! We’re only 20 minutes outside of the planet’s gravity! We’ll explode before even touching the ground if we hit the planet’s atmosphere at the speed we’re going!”
BRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!
The engine accelerated even more. 
“Shit!” Robert said. 
Tiffany, face wet with tears took Rebekah by the shoulder. “Rebekah, can’t you cut off the ship’s communications!?” 
“I can, but we won’t be able to land!” 
“But at the very least, you can stop them from shutting the ship down completely, right!?” Tiffany asked.
“Do it, Rebekah!” Quelatune said.
Rebekah got up from her seat, jogged over to another part of the room and opened up a small door. Before her were several fuses and wires.
“Come on, come on,” Rebekah whispered to herself while looking for the right one.
“Here it is!” she said. She yanked a large wire from its socket. Suddenly all the monitors went off and a large shutdown was heard throughout the room as the lights dimmed momentarily.
Rebekah unplugged another wire and plugged it in place of the wire she unplugged and the monitors sprang back to life. Marxis was on all of the monitors looking around in panic. 
“Thank God!” Quelatune said. “Can you hear me!?”
No answer. Marxis was on the screen trying to say something but he wasn’t audible.
“Hang on, Father. I’m still working on it,” Rebekah said.
She unplugged another large wire and plugged it back in. There was a loud pop in the speakers.
“Father! Can you hear me!?” Marxis asked. He was loud and clear. Yes!
“Yes, Marxis!” Quelatune answered. “I can! Can you hear us!?”
“Yes I can!” 
“Thank God!”
“We have another problem though, Father!” Marxis said. “Rebekah cut off the engine’s communications to us. That means you won’t be able to  land or slow down and you’re going way too fast! You’re only five minutes away from the planet’s gravity! That box will not be able to handle the turbulence going at that speed once you hit the planet’s atmosphere!”
Rebekah rushed back over to the control deck and started frantically turning dials and pushing buttons. “Slowing it down won’t be a problem,” she said. “All I have to do is turn the blasters opposite directions. Landing though, that’s gonna—”
“Wait!” Tiffany said. Everyone turned back to her. “Father Quelatune, didn’t you say that rebels have been in the Desert of Illusion fighting the Kwans!? They can help us, right!?”
Everyone paused.
Quelatune clapped loudly as if he had an idea. “That’s it, Tiffany!” 
Rebekah shrugged.
“What are you talking about!?” Marxis asked.
“She’s talking about the X1,” Quelatune said.
“I am?” Tiffany blurted out.
Quelatune hopped up from his seat, wheels in motion. “Marxis, get the rebels to send up the X1! The X1 can merge with this box and we’ll be able to land. Not only that but we’ll be able to take care of the hostiles!”
“Alright, we’re on it,” Marxis said. “Signing out for now!” 
The monitors went back to the litany of maps and the live camera feed of them getting closer and closer to Gaia. 
As if all of that wasn’t enough, a loud buzzer went off.
Rebekah looked up. “Oh boy. We’re low on fuel.”
“The X1 better come and get us now,” Quelatune said.
“What the hell is the X1?” Robert asked.
Quelatune turned to Robert. “It’s a very large battle airship. Rulose Island has been supplying the rebels with arms and the X1 is one of those arms that we gave to them. It was once one of our battleships so it shouldn’t have any problem merging with this box. The only thing is that the X1 is only designed for very brief space travel, no more than 20 minutes or so. But that won’t be a problem because all it has to do is come get us. Not only that, but the X1 is a beast of a fighter. All the guns and missiles anybody could ask for and the Kwans’ anti-aircraft guns on the ground are no match for it.”
Marxis reappeared on all of the monitors. “Alright, we got in touch with the rebels and they can send the X1. The only problem though is that their pilots are still being trained to fly it.” 
Everyone on board looked at each other.
Quelatune asked, “How confident in their abilities are they in flying it, Marxis?” 
“I couldn’t get a handle on it, but their pilot who is supposed to be on his way here, let’s just say he can fly it around an empty sky without any problems. He’s never flown it around when a large group of Kwans were trying to take it out. He knows how to use all of the weapons and activate the Shield but he hasn’t had much practice in real-world combat. Unfortunately, none of our pilots from Rulose Island are available in that region to help him. As I said, their top pilot is leaving the station now as we speak. We’ll keep you posted. I have to check back with them. I’m out for now.”
Marxis was gone. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Quelatune orders Angelina to get the rebels to help them. Angelina says they're on it. They send rebel ship X1 to fuse with the box.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Quelatune sat down on the couch. “Our lives are now in the hands of a trainee”, he said.
“Not for long,” Robert said standing up. “I’m a pilot, remember?”
Rebekah turned to Robert. “How do you know if Earth’s aircraft are anything like ours?” 
“Actually, they’re just like theirs,” Quelatune said. “We modeled our aircraft to be similar to Earth’s. We had an old design that worked for a while but aircraft control was one of the few things Earthlings did better than us, so we copied it.”
“Great!” Robert said. “That means I can help them out!”
Rebekah turned to Robert again. “Easy, Tiger. You can help them out as soon as we merge with this box.” 
Marxis reappeared on the monitors. “The X1 has launched, they’re coming up, guys!”
A camera shot of a handsome South Asian man surrounded by several controls appeared on one of the monitors. “Cypher here reporting! Going up now. We’re almost at altitude. Unfortunately, no crew. I’m all you got.” 
Quelatune said, “Here’s what the plan is, Cypher. Robert is an ace fighter pilot from Earth, so he’s going to co-pilot with you as soon as we merge to deal with the hostiles, OK?”
Marxis gasped. “Whoa, wait! What!?” 
Rebekah waved her hand as if not wanting to argue with him. “It’s a done deal, Marxis. We’re doing it.”
Marxis still wanted to argue. “Hang on, just wait a minute, we—”
“Marxis,” Quelatune said. “How close are we to the planet’s atmosphere?”
“Huh!? Uh…” Marxis glanced to the left. “I’d say about fifteen minutes, Father.”
Quelatune looked over at Rebekah.
“We’re gonna be cutting it real close,” she said.
Marxis said, “Cypher, put the pedal to the metal, you gotta get up there as fast as you can!” 
“On it, sir!” Cypher answered.
Robert took Tiffany by the hand. She was shaking in fear. This was becoming a bit much for her to handle. “It’s gonna be alright, Tiff,” he said.
Quelatune turned to Cypher. “Cypher, I need you to answer a question. How much training have you guys had in merging with a box?”
“You really wanna know?” Cypher asked. “None.” 
Everyone including Marxis on the monitor sighed. Quelatune was hoping Marxis wasn’t correct that this guy was a newbie.
“Wonderful,” Rebekah said, throwing her hands up in frustration.
“I’ve got this, guys, don’t worry about it!” Cypher reassured. 
“You don’t understand, Cypher,” Rebekah said. “We don’t have control of our ship. I had to cut off the controls because the Kwans, by jamming the communication between Angelina and the box, tampered with it. That means you’re going to be doing all of the work. That’s a very difficult procedure. One thing goes wrong, you’ll mess up the merge and it will do us no good!”
“Stop making me nervous,” Cypher said.
Quelatune whispered, “You’re making him nervous, Rebekah.” 
“I’m just being honest,” Rebekah said.
“You’re being pessimistic,” Quelatune said.
“Guys!” Robert said. Quelatune and Rebekah turned to him. “Reconnect the controls.” 
“Robert, Lemor-Ixa will take control of them again,” Quelatune said.
“Think about it,” Robert continued. “We disconnected the controls and have had them disconnected for a while now. Lemor-Ixa probably gave up. She’s probably not coming back.”
“I don’t know, Robert,” Rebekah said.
“I think Robert has the right idea,” Quelatune said. “Rebekah, go reconnect the controls.” 
Rebekah sighed, got up and ran over to the small door she was at before and opened it. She pulled the big wire she pulled out before and unplugged the wire she replaced it with. Every monitor went out momentarily but came back on when she re-plugged everything and shut the door. The lights dimmed for a second but nothing else seemed to happen. She then ran back over to the controls and started adjusting things.
Cypher called out, “Alright, I’m in orbit!” 
“Marxis, how far apart are we?” Rebekah asked.
Marxis glanced to his left. “Uh, I’d say in about five minutes you two are gonna meet.” 
Rebekah called out to Cypher, “You mess this up, we’re all dead! You know that, right!?”
“Rebekah, please stop making him nervous!” Tiffany shouted.
Rebekah looked at Tiffany with contempt and was about to say something but thought the better of it. Cypher continued to focus. Robert looked at the monitor and the image of Gaia was taking up most of the screen. They were that close to the planet now. He saw no image of the X1 anywhere.
“Where is he?” Robert asked.
“He’s coming, Robert,” Marxis said.
Tiffany pointed at the screen. “Hey look, there he is!” 
Robert looked at the monitor again and could see the X1 coming into view. It was still kind of small on the monitor but he could see that it was a very impressive looking ship. It quickly started to grow in size on the screen as they drew closer and closer to it. 
“Wow…” Robert said in awe, impressed by how incredible this ship was. It was massive, at least twice the size of a commercial jet from Earth. “That thing is huge,” he said as the ship loomed closer to them. Its design was sophisticated and heavily armored, not shaped like anything from Earth. Steel gray, its design was angular, hi-tech and had several guns on it, large and small. If one could imagine in the year 2190 on Earth, the US Air Force wanted to design the biggest, greatest attack aircraft in the world, it probably wouldn’t be anywhere close to this impressive. Several large plates on the ship started to move and change formation as mechanical processes caused a large opening to form under the hull.</Text>

            <Text>“Pretty neat, huh?” Tiffany whispered.
“Merge sequence initiated,” Cypher said. 
The ship was only about two football fields away at this point and took up most of the monitor screen. Robert was blown away by how incredible this machine looked that it was almost lost on him how dire the present situation was. Everyone around him was working diligently but he couldn’t help but marvel at how freaking cool this thing was!
Rebekah steadily moved a joystick to where a cursor highlighted something on a map on one of the monitors. “Alright, here we go. Tell me when to go ahead, Marxis.” 
Marxis started counting down. “8….7….6…..5……4…..”
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
The engine began to purr again.
“3….2….1….Go, go, go!”
Rebekah hit a button at the top of the joystick and suddenly Robert and Tiffany heard mechanical processes going on above the ceiling of the box.
“Initiating merge process now, Father!” Rebekah said.
Quelatune nodded, which made Robert and Tiffany feel better since his nodding meant things were going the way they were supposed to. 
Cypher braced himself. “Contact any moment now, guys!” 
Robert saw on the monitor that they were getting closer and closer to the large opening in the ship’s hull. They were only about 50 feet from it.
Soon, the box rose up to the point of going inside the large opening. The plates and mechanics of the behemoth X1 closed up, swallowing the box. The monitor that had been displaying a few of outside was now a blank screen as the box was completely shrouded in darkness. They then heard and felt fastening all around the box. The box jolted one last time.
Ding…
The gentle bell sound from earlier sounded and everyone breathed a sigh of relief as a power-down hum echoed throughout the box before going silent. Tiffany and Robert applauded as did Quelatune.
“Merge complete guys!” Cypher said.
Quelatune gave Cypher a thumbs up. “Great job, Cypher!” 
The double-doors of the box opened and they were met with a long hallway.
Quelatune and Rebekah left their controls and headed out of the box into the X1. Robert and Tiffany followed. The hallway was as large as one would expect and looked like the hallway of a space-age military complex. Robert was rapt. “What an impressive ship this is, Father Quelatune.”
“Thanks Robert. It cost us a fortune,” Quelatune said. “The X2 is even better than this one though. That one is back in  Angelina. You’ll get to meet its designer once we get back.” 
They approached a sliding door and entered a large room full of seats and controls. This was the control room and cockpit of the X1.
“Robert, this is where you and Cypher are going to do your work,” Quelatune said.
There were large windows all around them revealing the sea of stars of outer space. It was the most beautiful room Robert had ever been in. In the center of the room was a large desk with a magnificent array of flight controls along with a large flight stick. There was a large deck that hang from the ceiling with even more controls and several screens for radar, altitude, temperature, oxygen, weather analysis and so on. Cypher was seen manning these controls. He turned around and smiled. “There you guys are!”  
Robert looked around again, still impressed. “We don’t have anything like this on Earth!”
Cypher shrugged and looked around. “Yeah, she’s a beauty. We’re really appreciative of it, that’s for sure.” He then looked over at the controls and back at Robert. “So you sure you up for helping me out with this thing?”
Robert was excited. He sat down at the controls in the co-pilot’s seat right next to Cypher. Some of the controls were familiar but a lot of them were not. Luckily, Cypher was there to give him a crash course. 
One of the controls Robert wasn’t familiar with was the Shield, which provided an energy force-field around the entire ship or just to the front end depending on the setting. Activating the Shield for too long wasted a lot of fuel so it was best to only apply it when it was necessary. He found it easy to select which guns he wanted to fire. Cypher was a good teacher but he could see why the X1 needed two pilots. 
Cypher told him, “I’m glad you’re co-pilot because I’m good at teaching. I’m not as good at actually doing.”
The X1 shook as they broke through the planet’s atmosphere at high speed. Blue sky surrounded them as they saw the clouds below. </Text>

            <Title>Dogfight!</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert and Cypher man the controls and are able to take neutralize the threat. </Synopsis>
            <Text>As they made their descent, Robert saw a vast expanse of desert and sure enough, metal objects moving on the ground. As they drew closer, he saw that these were weaponized vehicles the likes of which he had never seen. 
Marxis suddenly appeared on one of the monitors. “Holy shit! Guys, get your minds right! A war machine is level with you!”
The radar screen started flashing red and an alarm went off. 
Cypher glanced quickly over at Robert and then straight ahead. “We’ve got a dogfight on our hands, guys!”
“A war machine is locked onto you, Robert! Activate your Shield!” Marxis said.
A pang of excitement punched Robert in the stomach. His heart raced. He did as he was told, flipped a switch on the desk and the Shield was activated. He heard a hi-tech purring sound throughout the ship. He heard a loud explosion but didn’t feel the impact of what was presumably a missile. That must have been the Shield working.
Robert’s adrenaline pumped through his veins. Everything around him became silent as he searched for the aircraft that hit him. “I can’t find what it was that hit me!” he said.
Cypher banked up and over  to the right. Everything on the radar screen spun around as the red dot which represented the war machine that hit him came into view.
The war machine rose up in front of him. A soft buzzer sounded to indicate to Robert that he had a lock on the target. He launched a missile. It flew with its long tail of smoke and made contact, blowing the war machine out of the sky. The explosion was spectacular, so much so that everyone in the X1 jumped with excitement. Robert cut off the Shield.
“Whoa! Kill!” Marxis said.
Rebekah pointed to the radar. “Two more in your corners, Bob!” 
The X1 rocked hard. They’ve been hit.
Robert looked around in panic. “The hell was that!?”
“We’ve been hit!” Marxis said.
Another big jolt was felt and they were rocked several more times. Robert remained focused. He’s been here before.
Cypher cried out, “We’re getting bombarded! Cut the Shields on again, Bob!”
Bob flipped the switch, cutting the Shield on. The soft, hi-tech hum throughout the ship sounded as the Shield re-activated. He turned the rear guns backwards.
Two large rear guns on the back of the X1 quickly spun backwards.
Robert, confident, felt like showing off. He glanced at Cypher and smiled. “Blind shot here. Watch this!”
Two powerful lasers fired from the rear guns that were turned backwards and sliced the left wing off one of the two war machines firing at them from behind. The war machine spun out of control and rammed hard into the other one next to it, blowing its wing off as well. Both of them mangled up with each other in a big fireball.
Quelatune gasped. “Whoa, that was incredible!”
Tiffany nodded with knowing admiration. “That’s my man.” 
Robert cut the Shield off again to save fuel, still focused. Another red pair of dots showed up on the radar. One of the war machines came into view. Robert fired another homing missile but it missed.
“He dodged it! Try it again, Robert!” Marxis said.
Robert didn’t. He flipped another switch and two smaller guns on each side of the ship rose from two compartments. 
Cypher looked over worriedly at Robert. “Uh, lasers? Those don’t home, those—”
“Suppression fire, Cy,” Robert said.
Robert fired. A litany of rapid-fire laser blasts burst from the guns.
The other war machine came into view. One banked up and the other to the right. Robert fired another homing missile again and nailed one of them to another spectacular explosion.
“Another kill, Robert! Wow!” Marxis said.
The other war machine fired a missile right at them. A powerful laser from the bottom of the X1 specifically designed to intercept head-on missiles fired and blasted the missile away. Robert fired another homing missile at the war machine. Another kill. He was in the zone, everyone was amazed and he knew it. Five kills in less than three minutes. That was unheard of even in the X1.
Quelatune nodded at Rebekah. “He’s a keeper.”
Cypher banked lower. 
Robert had a clear view of the litany of space-age rolling tanks and walking battle mechs on the ground. He gasped in amazement at what he saw. “My God, this looks like Star Wars!”
Cypher chuckled. “Star Wars? That space movie that plays on your planet?”
The tanks and battle mechs’ gunfire was feeble and did little damage to the X1. The X1 fired back and those tanks and mechas were no match. Gunfire rained down from the X1 as its massive shadow loomed over the desert. Robert saw the anti-aircraft gun and blew it straight to Hell.
The vehicles started to retreat as a firestorm of missiles and lasers from the X1 continued to rain down. Kwan militants jumped out from their vehicles and started running away on foot.
A spare war machine was on the ground as several Kwans hopped inside. The war machine’s back door closed and it instantly rose into the air and flew off. 
“Dammit! Well, some of them got away!” Rebekah said. “Get ready for landing, Cypher”.
Cypher eased the throttle back. “Going into landing sequence now.”
The landing sequence was tricky because they were on uneven ground. The impact from the landing was so intense that everyone on board the X1 almost fell over.
The engine was cut off. It was now quiet. Smoke and convection clouded the hot dry desert that surrounded them. It reminded Robert of Mogadishu. His head was damp with sweat as he sighed and leaned back in his seat. His job was done. 
Everybody applauded him.
Quelatune placed his hand on Robert’s shoulder and smiled. “Now you see why we brought you here, Bob?”
Robert laughed softly even though his nerves were still taut. 
“Seriously, son, you’re the….second best pilot I’ve ever seen.”
Robert turned to Quelatune. “Who’s the first?”
“Amaga. She’s our Secretary of Defense at the ripe old age of 24. She’s incredible. She’s also the designer of this ship as well as the X2 back in Angelina.”

They left the X1, Robert and Tiffany finally stepped foot on this unfamiliar planet for the first time. They looked around and were surprised by how much it looked like Earth. Around them was destruction. Battle mechs and tanks were on fire as plumes of black smoke billowed from several destroyed vehicles. Robert was almost in awe of what he did. 
”Let’s go back inside,” Quelatune said, leading everyone back inside the X1.</Text>

Rebekah lifted her baby from the crib. Tiffany was shocked to find that the baby boy she was holding in her arms was a baby Kwan with a bald head, pointed ears and kitten-like eyes. Tiffany didn’t know what to say but Rebekah could see she was surprised. Tiffany didn’t do a good job of hiding her emotions.
Indicating Tiffany’s expression, Rebekah said, “Have a seat, Tiffany.”
Tiffany sat down on the couch with Rebekah. The baby babbled just like any other baby. Rebekah then bottle fed him. He was actually adorable and precious. It’s crazy how ruthless and militant the Kwans are yet their babies are just as innocent looking and gentle as human babies. 
“So this is my son, Skyler. You may be wondering why he’s a Kwan,” Rebekah said.
Tiffany said nothing. She figured she was better off listening and not talking at this moment.
“My son is a Kwan because I am a Kwan, Tiffany.”
Tiffany was taken aback completely. “Wh, what!?”
“It’s well known to everyone here in the Temple but it isn’t something the public knows about.” Rebekah then looked up at Tiffany. Her face hardened. “We prefer to keep it that way, understood?”
Tiffany nervously nodded. “Sure, sure.”
Rebekah continued. “I underwent cosmetic surgery in getting my ears clipped. I also wear contact lenses and a wig to look like a human.”
Tiffany was speechless.
“There’s more,” Rebekah said. “Not only am I a Kwan, but I am Queen Riptide’s older sister.”
Tiffany’s jaw dropped. “You’re joking.”
“Many years ago back on Kwantar before Riptide was even born, our mother, Queen Avalon, was still the ruler of Kwantar and I was the rightful heiress to the throne. But I ran away. I didn’t like the manner in which my mother ruled our people. She was a tyrant who sapped the planet’s resources. So, many of our people became nomads for a decade, led by my mother, raiding planet after planet for ten years. It was during this time, Riptide was born. After ten years of their nomadic pillaging and plundering of every habitable planet, they settled on this planet and conquered it with the exception of Rulose Island. It was at this time, six years ago, that my sister took the throne after our mother’s death and decided to wage war on Rulose Island.”
“So what brought you here to Rulose Island?” Tiffany asked.
“During my mother’s reign, she kept me alive. Under Kwan law, an heir to the throne denying their birthright is an act of treason punishable by death. But my mother didn’t want to have me executed because after all, I was still her daughter, so she spared me.”
“I’m gonna take a wild guess as to what happened once Riptide took the throne,” Tiffany said. 
Rebekah nodded. “You guessed it. She did not have the same compassion for me that my mother did. Her first order of business was to have me tried and executed.”
“So you sought refuge here on Rulose Island because of that?”
“I didn’t just seek refuge, Tiffany.”
“Oh?”
“I came to Rulose Island right after my sister took the throne because I knew she’d not only come after me, but she would come after Rulose Island for allowing me to stay here. This war was not just fought for control over the Kaoli Emerald like many people believe. It was also fought for control over me. If the Kwans take over Rulose Island, I’ll have nowhere else to take refuge as they will rule the entire world. I will surely be executed. I’m sure you can see now why I take my job so seriously.”
“I totally understand, Rebekah.”
“Father Quelatune in his brilliance elected me as Head Counselor, the second most powerful office in the country, because I would be granted far more protection than a private citizen. If the Kwans attacked or killed me, it would essentially be taken, per the Rulose constitution, as a declaration of war.”
Tiffany chuckled. “Well, that ship has sailed, hasn’t it? This country is at war with the Kwans.”
“I know that all too well, Tiffany.” 
Rebekah was silent for a moment as she rocked her son.
“You OK, Rebekah?”
Rebekah looked back up at Tiffany. “Tiffany, what was the real reason you decided to pay me a visit tonight?”
Tiffany was almost afraid to answer the question. She wanted to defend her usefulness to Rebekah but was afraid of how she would respond.
“Rebekah, I came here because I want you to know that Robert insisted that I come with him to this planet for a reason. I may not be able to undergo this Kaoli Man project, nor am I a fighter pilot or a military scientist, but—”
“Tiffany,” Rebekah said. “Don’t worry about trying to impress me, OK? I was hard on you yesterday evening because I take my job very seriously. But maybe I was being unfair to you.”
Tiffany was surprised to hear this.
Rebekah continued. “A lot of people have let me down in my life and so it’s almost my default position not to trust others. I shouldn’t put that on you because the more I’ve thought about it today, the more I’ve realized that you have given me no reason to believe what I initially thought about you. So for that I am truly sorry.”
Tiffany sighed with relief. She was so glad Rebekah apologized to her. “It’s OK, I understand. You care about you’re mission and you’re just trying to do your job.”
Rebekah leaned back, almost looking out into space. “These past couple of months have been very difficult for me, Tiffany.” 
“What’s going on?” 
“Like you, I lost my husband.”
Tiffany was surprised. The more she was learning about Rebekah, the more she was beginning to understand her. It was like a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders.
“It’s only been six months since he passed away. I was still pregnant with Skyler when he died. My son is never going to know his father,” Rebekah said as her voice broke up. 
Tiffany took Rebekah’s hand. She felt pain for this poor woman. As hurt as Rebekah was, she was glad she was opening up to her.
“May I ask how he died?” Tiffany asked.
“He was a Kwan Marshal, a military leader,” Rebekah said. “They found out we were together during the war and they took him.”
“Treason?”
“Yeah, treason.”
Tiffany put her arm around Rebekah and hugged her. Rebekah didn’t resist. Tiffany couldn’t believe she was reaching out to Rebekah in this way. Rebekah hugged her back and the two were silent, not even crying, just embracing each other, bonding for the first time, alien and human.
“You’re a good person, Rebekah,” Tiffany said. “It’s OK to feel vulnerable and hurt. Nobody’s gonna judge you.”
Rebekah nodded solemnly. “You know, Tiff, you’re honestly the last person I ever imagined telling this to.”
Tiffany smiled. “I’m actually really glad to hear that.”
“I’m glad you came here,” Rebekah said. “Thank you.”
They hugged again as though they were best friends.
“Let’s start over,” Tiffany said happily.
“Yeah, I’d like that.” 
Rebekah shrugged. “So what do you want to do?”
Tiffany glanced over at the television. It was the exact same type of television set in the wall that was in her and Robert’s apartment. She picked up the remote and smiled. “Have you seen Casablanca?”
Rebekah laughed. “Casa-what”?</Text>

            <Title>Arrive in Angelina</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert and Tiffany arrive in Angelina and tour the city and try the food. They arrive at the temple and move in. Robert remembers almost kissing Tiffany.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The rest of the airship ride to Angelina was uneventful. Robert, however, worried that since Rebekah didn’t approve of Tiffany if anyone else on Rulose Island would. Despite Rebekah’s claims, Father Quelatune didn’t seem to dislike her and neither did Marxis. Before Rebekah spoke to them, he and Tiffany almost kissed. He could feel himself being drawn to her in a way he could not explain. Maybe I’m just vulnerable right now, he thought. The feelings that were running through him in that moment had to have been nothing more than just being caught up in the moment. He hoped Tiffany would not bring up what happened ever again but he worried that he was beginning to develop feelings for her. 
They touched down at the Angelina airport. They stepped off the airship and looked around. The airport didn’t look much different from one on Earth other than the fact that it looked like an airport that would exist on Earth a hundred years from now. 
Father Quelatune gave Robert and Tiffany payment cards so that they may eat and shop with no spending limit, all on the government’s dime. A guide showed them around Angelina. This was nothing like Candel Village and definitely not like the Desert of Illusion. It was an absolute space-age metropolis that was super crowded like New York or Tokyo. Public transportation was the norm. Very few people had their own cars, which looked surprisingly similar to cars on Earth, except, like everything else in Angelina, looked a century ahead of even the most forward-thinking concept cars. Instead of steering wheels, the cars used flight sticks similar to what was seen in the X1. The architecture of buildings looked right out of Blade Runner or The Fifth Element and the streets were cleaner than anything you’d find on Earth. Futuristic aircraft peacefully and quietly loomed over the city. There were electronic billboards and city lights that were present all throughout the urban centers, lighting up the night sky. They had dinner at a restaurant called The Raindrop which served “authentic rural Rulose food”. The cuisine was, um, interesting but delicious. Tiffany and Robert ordered the same thing, which was a dish called Pondrel: a large, seemingly barbecued sea creature that the chef cut in half right in front of them. It was super spicy and kind of sweet but really good. It was served with a side of large stuffed peppers that were boiled in water called Ornaments that you dip in this delicious sauce called Goo. Yes, literally, that’s what they called it. The popular drink on Rulose Island was this beverage called Dormo, which is sweetened warm milk spiked with an alcoholic beverage similar to rum. They both tried one sip and thought it was disgusting so they just ordered two ice waters.
They were then driven to the Rulose Temple, a beautiful, enormous, 32-story building in the Northern borough of Angelina. They walked into the lobby and looked around them. It was super busy and chaotic even at this late hour with people working the front desk, government officials talking with each other, press people trying to get a story and lobbyists shouting to get their bills passed. It kind of reminded them of Capitol Hill. They were able to be taken to the elevator without being noticed and started going up. They eventually stepped off the elevator and into a quiet hallway. They were then taken to a really nice area that looked like an upscale three bedroom apartment with a high ceiling that provided a gorgeous view of the Angelina skyline. There was a nice large leather couch and love seat in the living room along with a super large 100-inch wide screen television in the wall. The place looked right out of a lifestyle magazine from the year 2100. They noticed their luggage was sitting on the couch.
“So, this is where you guys are gonna be staying,” the guide said.
Robert looked around. He was really impressed. They both then heard a crackling sound.
Father Quelatune appeared on their television screen even though the television was turned off.
“Like it?” he asked through the screen with a smile as his voice echoed in surround sound.
They both jumped back with surprise not expecting him.
“Um, yeah, it’s great. We love it, Father Quelatune! Thank you!” Robert said gratefully.
“As much as I’d like to show you around the rest of the Temple, we need you guys to get as much sleep as possible because we have an early start tomorrow. We have a lot to talk about. I hope you guys had fun, but tomorrow things are gonna get real.”
The TV cut off and the guide dismissed himself. Robert and Tiffany looked at each other and smiled. Robert then said, “We’re in this now, Tiff.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Tiffany thanks Robert for taking up for her but she still seems down on herself. Robert contemplates bringing up their kiss but he decides not to.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert was so tired he didn’t even bother to unpack. He went straight to his bedroom, cut the lights off and crashed in his clothes. He woke up the next morning and made his way into the living room. Tiffany was in the adjacent kitchen in her pajamas, Harvard sweatshirt, hair tied with no makeup on rummaging through the fridge making a sandwich.
She looked up at him and smiled. “Hey, Bob. How did you sleep?”
“I slept really well, Tiff, thanks,” he said.
He then looked at the TV which was still turned off. He saw instructions on how to operate it sitting on the coffee table in front of him. Apparently, you touch the coffee table and the TV cuts on automatically. Robert touched the coffee table and sure enough, the TV turned on but there were no channels nor was there anything on. He was literally met with just a blue screen. He picked up the remote and besides the power button, there wasn’t much else. There was a big round button that said “REQUEST” but no matter how many times he pressed it, nothing happened. There were also UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT buttons along with an OK button but nothing else. None of these buttons did anything.
“Yeah, I couldn’t get it to work either. I’ll try to ask how to get it to work,” Tiffany said while she finished making her sandwich. She then sat down on the couch next to him. “So, what’s up?”
There was a lot on Robert’s mind. He couldn’t stop thinking about the moment they almost kissed on the airship, nor could he stop thinking about Rebekah’s apparent disdain for Tiffany and how much it worried him. He turned to face her. “Tiffany, I really need you to know how much I appreciate you being here.”
Robert realized he had told her this many times already but there was something in him that felt like Rebekah’s words might have gotten to her a little bit.
Tiffany nodded. “I really appreciate you taking up for me yesterday. Thank you.”
“People are gonna soon find out why I wanted you to come here,” Robert said. “They’re gonna know what you’re worth. You’re an amazing woman, and I need you to know that.”
“I understand, Bob.”
Tiffany didn’t really sound like she believed him but he wasn’t sure why. Did Rebekah really shake her up that badly or was there something else? 
“Rebekah doesn’t know you the way I do,” Robert said. “She’s not in a position to judge you the way she did yesterday.”
Tiffany shook her head dismissively. “I’m not worried about Rebekah, Bob.”
Robert still felt she was keeping something from him. He took her hand. “Tell me what’s really going on, Tiff.”
Tiffany sighed and said nothing.
“Tiffany,” he insisted.
“I’m good, Bob,” she said faking a smile. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.”
Robert knew she wasn’t being completely honest, but he also knew he wasn’t going to get any more out of her than what he got. He was tempted to bring up their near-kiss but he thought the better of it.</Text>

            <Text>Tiffany wanted some time to be alone. She went into her purse, lit a cigarette and took a drag. She rarely smoked and only did so when she was stressed out.
The fact that Father Quelatune would not allow her to undergo the operation bothered her because she truly felt she would be even more useless than she already felt she was. What good would she be now when not only is Robert an ace pilot, but he’ll have the power to call up powerful forces from the Spirit World? She felt that the longer she stayed there, the less useful she would become in the eyes of those who were skeptical of her. 
The image of Rebekah berating her on the airship still played in her mind. She could not help but feel as though she truly was useless. Maybe Rebekah was right after all, especially if she knew Robert would be undergoing an operation that would give him magical powers and she wouldn’t.
Tiffany knew that before she could convince herself she was valuable to the team, she had to convince Rebekah. She really wanted to make things right with her. </Text>

            <Synopsis>She goes by Rebekah's quarters unannounced. Rebekah is slightly stand-offish at first but lets her in to talk.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tiffany went down the elevator to the lobby, went over to the front desk and asked the receptionist working, “Hi, is there any way I could get in touch with Rebekah?”
The clerk laughed. “You kidding? Rebekah the Head Counselor doesn’t just sit down and chat with anyone. I might be able to get you in touch with her staff.”
“Rebekah knows who I am,” Tiffany said. “Get me in touch with somebody that can get me in touch with her.”
The clerk eyed her suspiciously. She then handed Tiffany a card. “Alright, Kiddo, here you go. That’s the floor her office is on, but I’m telling you, you probably won’t get in.”
Tiffany rolled her eyes and started to make her way back to the elevator. 
She went up to the floor that Rebekah’s office was on. She went over to the front desk. “Hi, I need to speak with Rebekah.”
“She’s actually off duty right now.”
“Isn’t her office and living quarters one in the same, like Father Quelatune?”
“That’s right, but she’s off duty.”
“I want to see her anyway. I’m coming to visit as a friend.”
The receptionist looked at her suspiciously. “Do I know you?”
“Probably not,” Tiffany answered, becoming more frustrated. “Look, can you get me Rebekah or not?”
The receptionist got up from her seat and started to walk off.
“Hang on,” she said with attitude.
She came back after a few moments and pointed to a hallway to her left. “Alright, take that hallway and when you get to the dead end, turn right and it’s the first door on your left.”
Tiffany made her way to Rebekah’s door. She felt the hand of fear grip her stomach. She had not contacted Rebekah or let her know she was coming. She had no idea how Rebekah was going to react but she was prepared for the worst. If Rebekah was super cruel to her, all she had to do was tell Father Quelatune she tried to make things right with her but she was not receptive to it.
She knocked on the door. Rebekah opened it. She was in a dark red bath robe without makeup on and still looked beautiful.
“Tiffany,” she said flatly.
“Hi, Rebekah. I, uh, know that this is weird and all. And maybe it’s not proper protocol for me to come over when you’re off duty and all, but, uh, I just, I just want us to be cool. I honestly feel like we got off on the wrong foot and I just wanna talk to you, hash things out with you. Is that OK?”
Rebekah sighed. “Tiffany, I really don’t have a problem with you.”
Tiffany said nothing. There was a brief awkward silence.
“Can this wait until tomorrow?” Rebekah asked, annoyed.
“I can come by tomorrow. That’s cool if you wanna—”
“You know what? Come in.”
Rebekah invited her in.</Text>

            <Title>Robert's supsicion</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany tells Robert that Rebekah is a Kwan, that she has a Kwan baby boy and her husband died a few months ago. She talks about how they're so much alike. Robert, however is now suspicious. He thinks back to the Kwans attacking them on the ship. He wonders how they knew they were going to land there and also, how was Lemor-Ixa able to hijack the box's controls? He suspects that maybe Rebekah isn't as trustworthy as she's letting on. He doesn't want to tell Tiffany this because she seems more at peace and happier than she has ever since she's arrived and he doesn't want to ruin that for her. Besides, he doesn't have any evidence but he's going to privately keep an eye on Rebekah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tiffany walked back into her and Robert’s apartment. Robert was watching a video of a Prince concert on TV when she came in. He turned down the volume. “Hey Tiff, how’re ya feeling?”
She smiled. “Good. I feel a lot better, actually.”
She sat down on the couch next to him and glanced at the TV. “Prince, huh?”
“Yeah. This is great, they have everything. You can call out anything on here and they probably have it. They’ve apparently been pulling stuff off of our satellites forever.”
Tiffany nodded, “Um, yeah, that’s pretty cool,” she said. “Hey, Robert, there’s something you’re gonna wanna know.”
He turned toward her. “Oh?”
“I went by Rebekah’s.”
Robert gasped. “What? Seriously?”
“Yeah, seriously. You’re not gonna believe the conversation we had.”

Robert finally headed to bed. He had an early start the next day. The operation was in a week and Father Quelatune had him visiting a doctor for a pre-operational checkup. 
He could not stop thinking about what Tiffany told him about Rebekah. Not only did Rebekah have a son but most of all, she was Queen Riptide’s older sister.
The Council wanted for this to remain a secret. Robert could easily see why they would because the public would never put their trust in someone with such close ties to the Kwan Empire’s leadership. He couldn’t stop thinking about the trip yesterday and how it seemed so convenient that the Kwans would know so far ahead of time they would have to perform an emergency landing in the Desert of Illusion. 
He then thought about how easy it was for Lemor-Ixa to hijack the box’s controls. He remembered asking Rebekah if such a thing had ever happened and he remembered her saying no. Tiffany told him Queen Riptide wanted Rebekah arrested, tried and executed for not accepting her birthright to the throne.
“That’s why Rebekah’s been so hard and that’s why she takes her job so seriously,” Tiffany said. “If we lose this war, Queen Riptide will not only have control of Rulose Island and the Kaoli Emerald, but Rebekah will have nowhere else to run and will surely be executed. This war is literally a matter of life and death for her.” 
Robert, however, felt differently. If Rebekah was in this deep with the Kwans to where she could face execution if Rulose Island is conquered, it is plausible for her to be willing to do anything to get out of that situation. Perhaps tipping the Kwans off to Father Quelatune’s location in order for him to be assassinated was a show of loyalty sufficient enough so that she may be spared in case Rulose Island is conquered. Robert didn’t want to believe this was true but he couldn’t help it. It just made too much sense! The fact is, an immediate family member of this nation’s sworn enemy is holding the second highest office in the country. Such a proposition, in his opinion, was beyond the pale.
But Tiffany was in better spirits than she had been since they arrived. She made peace with Rebekah and he didn’t want to ruin that for her. He didn’t have any evidence that any of these feelings he had about Rebekah were warranted. It was then that he decided he would not bring any of this up until more evidence presented itself, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be keeping an eye on her.</Text>

            <Text>Later that afternoon, Robert went through the four hours of medical checkups and was able to arrange a meeting with Father Quelatune. They met in Quelatune’s living room.
“Alright, Robert. Tell me how you’re feeling.”
“I’m feeling better than I did a few weeks ago for sure,” Robert said. “I have to say though that something has come to my attention that I want to talk to you about.”
“What’s up?”
“Well, I found out Rebekah is a Kwan.”
Quelatune nodded. “Rebekah told me she told Tiffany. How do you feel about that? And be honest.”
“Well, honestly, I’d feel fine about it if when we were on our way here, our box wasn’t hijacked by a Kwan general and we didn’t get into a dogfight in the desert with the Kwans before landing. How did they know we had to make an emergency landing unless—”
“Hold it, Robert. Are you suggesting that Rebekah is a mole?”
Robert didn’t know how to answer that. He really did believe something fishy was up but he could see Quelatune already getting uncomfortable. 
“I’m not suggesting anything, but you asked me to be honest and I’m going to be. I am concerned.”
“I understand. Listen, we have no reason to believe Rebekah is conspiring with the Kwans. They want her executed.”
“Think about it, Father. If she can tip the Kwans off and they’re able to assassinate you, maybe they’d spare her. There’s a possibility she could have been told that.”
“Robert, you’re letting your imagination run away with you.”
“Can I talk to Amaga?”
“Amaga?”
“I talked to her brother, Smoke. He said that Amaga would know how easy it was for Lemor-Ixa to hijack the controls of the ship.”
“Robert, it was Rebekah who disconnected the communications so that Lemor-Ixa couldn’t hijack the ship anymore. Now why would she do that if—”
“She only did that after you told her to. Tiffany’s idea might have ruined Rebekah’s plans. Notice how cold Rebekah’s been to Tiffany since. This all just makes too much sense to me, Father.”
Father Quelatune sighed. He then turned toward an intercom and started punching numbers in.
“Yes, Father!” said a man’s voice on the intercom.
“Yes, Rayo, tell RDD to have Amaga come by here when she gets the chance today. I need to arrange a meeting for her with the Earthlings.”
“What for?” the voice over the intercom asked.
“Just do it,” Quelatune said and punched another button to hang up.
“Alright, Robert,” he said. “She’ll come by your apartment later on tonight.”
Robert smiled. “Thank you, Father.”
“Yeah, yeah, now get outta here.”
Robert left, happy he was finally going to be able to get to the bottom of this.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Rebekah and Quelatune give Robert his first official mission: babysitting Skyler. Seriously?</Synopsis>
            <Text>The next morning, Robert and Tiffany were asked to report to Father Quelatune. They were told they would be given their first mission. Robert mentally prepared himself the way he did for briefings back when he was in the Army. He took a deep breath and headed to Quelatune’s office. He was ready for anything, or at least he thought he was.

“Babysitting? Are you serious?”
Father Quelatune rolled his eyes. “Look, I understand. I know you were anticipating something just a tad bit more, well, up your alley, but Rebekah insisted on the two of you.”
Tiffany seemed a lot more excited about this than Robert did. “We’d love to, Father!” She then turned to Robert. “Oh Bob, wait ‘till you see him! He’s the most adorable little thing!”
“Is babysitting a Kwan baby different from babysitting a human baby?” Robert asked.
“They don’t cry as much,” Quelatune said. “They poop more, though.”
Robert thought to himself, I better be getting paid for this.
“You have a government spending card with no spending limit. What more do you want?” Quelatune asked, laughing.
Robert laughed. “It’s almost as if you read my mind.”</Text>

            <Title>Tiffany's doubts</Title>
            <Synopsis>Taking care of Skyler made Tiffany miss her son. She wondered if she was being a bad mother and if her parents were right. Robert consoles her and tells her that she made the right decision to come.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Things turned out to be a piece of cake for Robert. He literally sat on the couch and watched television while Tiffany was doing all of the work and enjoying it. She fed Skyler, gave him some formula and sang him to sleep. Robert was amazed at how good of a mother she was. He thought to himself momentarily about her possibly being the mother of his child one day but he pushed that thought to the back of his mind. 
She sat down next to him after placing Skyler back in his crib. Robert felt kind of bad about not doing hardly anything.
“Sorry I’m not being much of a help,” he said.
She laughed and tapped his knee. “You just relax. I got this.”
“I have to say, Tiff, you’re such a great mother.”
She looked away as her expression changed.
Robert, wondering what he did wrong said, “What? I just said you were a good mother.”
Tiffany looked as though she wanted to say something but didn’t.
“Something on your mind?” Robert asked.
“No. Nothing,” Tiffany said as she looked down at the floor.
“Tiffany, I know you pretty well. What’s going on?”
She shook her head solemnly.
Robert then knew what was going on. “You miss your son, don’t you?”
Tiffany nodded quietly. “I wonder all the time if I made a mistake coming here, leaving him behind. That’s the main reason why I’ve been so insecure about being of use here. I don’t want me leaving Michael behind on Earth to be for nothing.”
Robert put his arm around Tiffany and took her hand. “Tiff, you know I would have never been able to get through any of this without you. My recovery alone was all the justification necessary for you to feel needed here.”
“The thoughts of my parents telling me how terrible of a mother I am just keep playing in my mind over and over again.”
“Tiffany, trust me, if they even knew half of what you’ve been doing over here, they’d be super proud.”
Skyler began to cry. Tiffany looked back at the crib. “I’m gonna let you handle this, Bob.”</Text>

            <Title>Robert's memories</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert, holding Skyler, made him long for a child and made him miss his wife Diane. They had been trying to have a child forever and when the doctor told them she had a T-shaped uterus, he remembered her crying and apologizing to him, blaming herself.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert went over to Skyler’s crib and lifted the baby Kwan up. The soft, warm body and kitten-like eyes of the baby melted Robert’s heart. Tears streamed down the baby’s face as Robert held him close. His little bald head rested on his shoulder. Robert took the moment in as his paternal desires flooded him. He thought about his wife Diane’s death as well as their prior efforts to have a child of their own. He remembered when the doctor told them she would likely not be able to have children and how much it hurt him. He remembered how Diane blamed herself and how much it broke his heart that she did. 
He sat down in the couch, rocking Skyler to sleep, thinking about the fatherhood he could have had. It was both a joy yet also a painful experience to hold this beautiful baby in his arms, even if the baby wasn’t human. He wondered how something so precious could possibly grow up to become so evil. It was then he thought about how much of an effect a child’s environment had on his outcome. The manner in which that child is raised and the values he is taught by his parents determines his destiny. Robert realized that it wasn’t the fault of those Kwan slave masters, soldiers or government officials why they were so evil, but rather, the parents that raised them to hate and subjugate those weaker than themselves. Robert was glad Skyler would be raised right. He was glad that Rebekah, the Kwan who sacrificed her birthright to the throne for the greater good, would be raising this little boy to do what was right. Skyler was gonna be alright.
Tiffany leaned her head on Robert’s shoulder, took his hand and whispered to him, “You would have been such a great dad.”

Later that evening, Rebekah came home and thanked Robert and Tiffany for taking care of Skyler. Later, Father Quelatune came by and asked them how it went.
“You knew we’d get something out of that, didn’t you?” Robert asked him.
Quelatune smiled. “You’re human just like we are, Robert.”</Text>

            <Title>Given crystal/Tiffany's citizenship</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany is given a job as medical advisor. She's granted citizenship. Robert is given his crystal. It is a necklace that he can wear. It was a glowing orange jewel. He's told to never take it off.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Since Tiffany was not allowed to undergo the Kaoli Man operation, Father Quelatune wanted for her to act as a medical adviser for future Kaoli Man projects just in case they decided to do them. Since providing professional medical advice required a license, she would have to become a Rulose Island citizen. Father Quelatune, being the President, was able to make that happen through an executive order. Her citizenship papers would say she was a Kwan Empire refugee in order to explain away her true origins but nonetheless, being a Rulose Island citizen gave Tiffany a sense of belonging she had not felt she had since arriving.
Meanwhile, Robert was no longer required to do medical checkups every day but still had to report to the sleep study room every night for another week. Physically, he felt fine and the side effects from the operation had all subsided. 
It was now time for him to start putting his new powers to the test. Rebekah arranged for him to do just that.
It was early in the morning when Robert and Tiffany were sent to a training facility in Castlerock, a major city about 200 miles south of Angelina on the coast. They put on their flight suit-like training uniforms given to them by Rulose staff and took an airship so that the trip would only be about 45 minutes. 
On the airship, Robert looked out the window and saw the skyline of Castlerock as they began to land. Castlerock looked much more like a large city on Earth than Angelina did. It was still quite futuristic, but much more industrial. Large plants with plumes of smoke coming out of the chimneys and hi-tech manufacturing centers lined the coast. Skyscrapers further back reached high into the muggy early morning sky.
After landing, they headed to the training facility which was an intense, massive concrete building about 20 miles outside of the city. The building had large black windows and large sliding doors that two Mack trucks could literally drive through. Behind the building, they saw a hi-tech air-traffic control tower along with parked battleships that all looked similar to the X1. At the top of the building, there was big plain font that read “BLUE DRAGON/BURGUNDY GUARD TRAINING CENTER OF RULOSE ISLAND NO. 3”. They walked inside and made their way down a dimly lit hallway. Along the walls were trophy racks with mannequins wearing what looked to be Class A uniforms. There were photos and gold medals next to them. They heard the clanging of metal in the background along with power tools.
“What’s that?” Robert asked looking around.
“Working on ships,” their guide said.
The guide went over to a metal door and placed his hand on a pod next to it. The door slid open.
“Follow me,” he said.
They were met immediately with metal stairs that went down a very narrow and dark hallway. The clanging of metal and power tools became less audible as they went down. The guide reached the bottom of the stairs and opened another door. They entered a massive, hi-tech empty room that looked like a metal and concrete warehouse. The glow of fluorescent lights above at the high ceiling emitted a faint buzzing sound as they cast the whole room in a faint greenish hue.
They then saw Amaga wearing the same training uniform Robert and Tiffany were wearing. 
“There you guys are! Good morning!” she called out as she walked over to them. 
“Good to see you again, Amaga,” Tiffany said.
“How are you feeling, Bob? You sleep well?”
Robert nodded. “Yes I did.”
“Good. I have something to give you. Prepare to be amazed.” She reached into her backpack and pulled out a jewelry box so big it had to be held with two hands. She opened the jewelry box and immediately, there was a reddish orange glow that surprised Robert. A large gold necklace laid in the velvety box with a jewel the size of a tube of lipstick emitting a bright, fiery glow. Tiffany and Robert were amazed.
“Go on. It’s yours. Take it,” she said smiling.
Robert was in awe as he took the necklace and examined the Crystal. The glowing wasn’t a solid glow. It was glowing as if abundant energy was radiating through it. He rubbed it. It felt smooth. He handed the necklace to Tiffany. She was in awe as the orange glow of the Crystal illuminated her face.
“This is amazing,” she whispered.
“That’s Robert’s life energy flowing through that Crystal. That’s your key to the Spirit World,” Amaga said.
Tiffany handed the necklace with the glowing jewel back to Robert.
“Throughout this training process, you must keep that necklace on at all times. Only when you are sleeping or showering should you take it off. You cool with that, Robert?”
Robert nodded. He was a little nervous as to what powers he was going to have.
“It turns out that your strongest connection to the Spirit World is through the element of Fire.”
“Interesting,” Robert said.
“Alright. We’re gonna try to channel some energy. We’ll start slow. Keep in mind you’re the first person we ever did this with so we know just as much as you do, which is practically nothing,” Amaga said.</Text>

            <Title>Training</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert is surrounded with makeshift dummies. Robert is told to focus hard but nothing happens. He's there for hours and nothing happens.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Some training dummies were later set up all around the warehouse by staff. 
“Alright, Robert. Like I said, we’re gonna start slow,” Amaga said. “In order to build a connection to the Spirit World, you have to focus. So close your eyes and focus.”
Robert nodded and closed his eyes. He concentrated hard. The fiery glow of his necklace got brighter and brighter. Whoooosh! There was an explosion of light as a bright burning orb appeared in Robert’s hand. He opened his eyes and saw the powerful, violently burning ball of fire he was holding.
Tiffany was both terrified and in awe as Robert, pupil-less and eyes glowing bright, had a large, bright burning fireball in his hand.
“That’s it, Robert! Aim at one of the targets and launch it!” Amaga said.
Robert launched the fireball at a target in front of him but as soon as he did, the fireball dissipated and fizzled out into a big cloud of dark gray smoke which made him cough loudly. His eyes were back to normal and the Crystal on his neck was back to its original brightness.
“That’s alright, Robert, it’s a start.”
Robert waved the smoke away with his hand as he continued to cough. “I didn’t hit anything did I?” he asked while still coughing.
“Nope. Not even close,” Tiffany said.
“Let’s try it again, Robert,” Amaga said.
Robert closed his eyes again and focused. His Crystal glowed bright as the explosion of light in his hand started the build-up of another fireball. 
“That’s it, Robert,” Amaga said. “Launch!”
Robert launched the fireball. It flew like a comet toward one of the dummies but it went up in smoke right before hitting its target. He sighed with frustration.
“Hey! That was better! You almost hit it!” Tiffany said, trying to encourage him.
“I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m trying. I really am,” he said.
“Come on. Let’s try it again,” Amaga said, still patient.
They tried several more times and Robert’s results didn’t improve. He would either successfully launch a fireball but it wouldn’t get far enough, or he would be unable to launch the fireball at all. Two hours went by and not one time did a fireball hit a dummy. Robert was tired and frustrated. Tiffany and Amaga both tried to be positive as they headed back to the airship.
Amaga said, “I’m sure this is something that’s going to take a while to master. We want to continue to work with you and build on the progress we made today.”
“I hope so,” Robert said. “So I can’t take this off at all throughout the next two weeks?”
“We believe the Crystal will make you stronger,” Amaga said. “We’ll have to see.”</Text>

            <Title>Nightmare</Title>
            <Synopsis>Robert wakes up in the middle of the night after a nightmare. He's still wearing the jewel. It's glowin BRIGHT. He lifts his head and spirit rushes out of his body and nearly destroys his apartment.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It would be the first time Robert could finally start sleeping in his own bed again. Unfortunately, he couldn’t sleep so he decided to take a walk. He made his way down the busy street and despite wearing the bright, glowing Crystal, people walked by, not even noticing him. He didn’t mind that at all.
Somebody behind him screamed, “Somebody help!”
Robert turned around and saw a robber trying to grab at a woman’s purse. He rushed over to them and pulled the robber off of her. He was bigger than the robber so he was able to shove him to the ground. The woman quickly ran off. Before Robert could even react, the robber pulled out a gun, aimed it at him and pulled the trigger.

Robert jolted out of bed. His breath was short and his heart was racing. He looked down at the Crystal. He was still wearing it. He must have dozed off with it still on. It was glowing much more brightly than it did before he fell asleep. The nightmare was vivid and there was no way he was going back to sleep after that. He got up out of the bed but his heart rate increased.
Spiritual flames of light floated from his body as the Crystal was blindingly bright. Worried, Robert was wondering what was going on. His hands suddenly each had bright fireballs in them. Robert was terrified. They flew from his hands and hit the walls. Part of the wall in front of him suddenly went up in flames.
“Oh shit!” Robert screamed. Robert quickly turned around and another fireball shot from his hand, causing another part of the wall to go up in flames. Robert removed the necklace but it didn’t do any good. He threw another fireball on accident and another part of the wall was caught on fire. Smoke filled his room. Thankfully, Robert brought a fire extinguisher with him from Earth. He got it out of his bag and was able to put out the fire. 
He sat on the bed panting, fire extinguisher still in hand. The only thing that illuminated the room was the Crystal which had dimmed to its normal brightness.
He sure wished he would have been able to do that in training. He couldn’t manage to even start a campfire but now he nearly burned his whole apartment down.
Robert cut the lights on and there were burn marks all over the walls but thankfully, nothing in the apartment was burned. Luckily the flames didn’t reach anything valuable. 
He went into the living room and could hear Tiffany snoring in her room. He didn’t wake her. After getting himself a drink of water in the kitchen, he went back into his room and went back to sleep, but this time he kept the Crystal on the nightstand.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Quelatune tells him that once he controls his powers that he will be able to summon the Rulose god of fire, Timothy. But that's a long way off. He needs to learn some simple spells. The department of defense is still looking into ways to channel his energy.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert woke up the next morning and was relieved to find his apartment still in one piece. He saw all the burns that were still on the walls of his room. He was hoping he had just dreamt what had happened in the middle of the night when his powers went out of control.
He heard the television on in the living room. Tiffany must’ve been up. Oh man is she gonna get a kick out of this! He put on the necklace and headed out of his room.
“Tiffany,” Robert called out as he came into the living room. She was watching The Young and the Restless.
Robert laughed, “Soaps? Really?”
“It’s something,” she said. “I’ve already seen this episode. They’re like, two months behind on this planet.”
She turned to him and looked him over, glancing at the necklace. “So how did you like sleeping in your own bed?”
“Tiff, let me show you something.”
“What’s up?” she asked.
“I can show you better than I can tell you.”
Tiffany got up and followed him to his room. Her jaw dropped.
“Robert! What the hell happened in here?” she asked, looking around the room at all the burns on the walls.
“I woke up in the middle of the night, the Crystal was glowing really bright and my powers went out of control. Fireballs flew out of my hands and I almost burned the whole place down! Thank God I brought a fire extinguisher!”
Tiffany had an uneasy look on her face. “I think you need to tell Amaga about this, or even Rebekah and Father Quelatune,” she said.

“You gotta understand, Father. We didn’t get anything done in training yesterday. Yet, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I nearly burn my entire apartment down!” Robert said.
Robert, Tiffany, Rebekah and Amaga were meeting with Father Quelatune in his office.
“Perhaps your training session tomorrow will go better than yesterday’s since you seem to be getting stronger,” Quelatune said. “I’m guessing what might be happening is that when you are in a heightened state of awareness your magic is stronger. It’s pretty clear the longer you keep the Crystal on, the stronger and stronger your magic becomes.”
“You might be right, Father,” Amaga said. “But there still doesn’t seem to be a way to truly channel Robert’s magic into something useful.” She turned to Robert. “We’ll figure something out, but in the meantime, make sure you take that Crystal off before you go to bed.”
Robert laughed. “You ain’t gotta tell me twice!”
“I think I might be able to weigh in on this,” Tiffany said.
Everyone turned to her.
“Maybe you guys can come up with some kind of, um, amplifier or weapon of sorts that he can channel his magic through.”
“That doesn’t sound like a bad idea, Tiff.”  Rebekah said with a smile. Tiffany smiled back.
“Amaga, can you get the Defense department to look into that idea?” Quelatune asked. “Something like a weapon Robert can use to aid him in channeling his powers?”
“Absolutely. We’ll get on that right away,” Amaga said.
“Good,” Quelatune said as he rose from the couch. “Robert, I would like to talk to you in private. The rest of you are dismissed.”
Everyone said their goodbyes and left. Quelatune sat back down on the couch with Robert. “Robert, I want to tell you something else about your powers.”
Robert was curious. “Sure, what’s up?”
“Do you remember when I told you about certain beings from the Spirit World?”
“Yeah.”
“Now look, this is a long way off, but once you master the use of your magic, you will be able to call upon one of these powerful beings yourself. Since your Element is Fire, I believe you will be able to call upon the aid of the Rulose god of Fire, Timothy.”
“Oh wow.”
“Timothy is a powerful dragon composed of heavenly fire. Once you have mastered your powers, you should be able to summon him and he will be at your command.”
Robert was excited. “Wow, so I take it learning to use my magic is pretty worth it, huh?”
“Absolutely, Robert. Timothy is more powerful than anything you’ve ever seen on this planet. But in order to call on him you must have the highest level of mastery and control over your powers. Unfortunately right now—”
“I can’t even light a match when I want to,” Robert said. “I’m really sorry, Father.”
Quelatune laughed. “You just started, Robert.” He then rubbed Robert’s shoulder. “Give it time, Son. You’re already getting stronger. You’ll get there, but I’m telling you right now, once you are able to call upon the great Timothy, the Kwans might as well give up because nothing they’ve got is any match.”
Robert made his way back down the elevator after his meeting with Father Quelatune. He couldn’t wait to tell Tiffany about what he just learned about his powers. He was far more powerful than he ever realized. He could now see why Quelatune and the Council spent millions of taxpayers’ dollars without their consent and risked political calamity to bring him to Gaia for this operation. If the goal was to make Robert a one-man army in control of a dragon god, he was down with that. More motivated than ever to master his powers, he decided he was going to train everyday and work harder than he ever had before.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Meeting and briefing over the planned attack. Rebekah has a bad attitude, gets into it with Tiffany and Amaga, saying that she thinks the mission is too dangerous and that they will get wiped out.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert was given a break for the next few days. He was able to catch up with Tiffany whom he had not seen since she became Head Counselor. 
She told him about the altercation she had with Rebekah in her office. Robert was both shocked and disappointed upon hearing this news because he and Rebekah got along so well at their training session together. He had hoped Tiffany and Rebekah would work out whatever differences they had but those hopes were now dashed.
Robert was called to another major meeting. This one was not in the board room like the last one. This was in the War Room over at Mission Control. Several top military personnel were present as Robert walked in. There were large screens with maps and diagrams and people working at large, high-tech computer stations. As soon as he walked in, everyone working at these stations started leaving.
Robert and Rebekah joined the many other top military brass at the large high-tech meeting table. At the head of the table was Father Quelatune, Tiffany, Marxis and Amaga. Rebekah sat next to Robert. Tiffany was sitting at the seat Rebekah would normally be sitting at. Robert was nervous because he had no clue what this meeting was about. He was also nervous because he did not know how Tiffany and Rebekah were going to co-exist in the same room.
“May I have your attention, everyone?” Quelatune asked. Everyone got quiet and turned their attention to him. 
“I want to say first of all that this meeting is absolutely top secret. Everything we talk about is completely classified information. Is that understood?”
Everyone confirmed that they understood.
Quelatune waved his hand, holding a remote. A large glowing hologram of Gaia appeared at the center of the table. He then touched a part of the hologram and it zoomed in to a spherical map of Amelrak. He touched the map again and it zoomed in on a factory. 
“Our intelligence has been working ‘round the clock investigating what has been going on at this factory and several others like it that have suddenly sprang up in the outskirts of Amelrak, the Kwan Empire’s capital city.”
He tapped a button on the remote with his thumb. The many large screens around the War Room lit up to show the inside of a large, hi-tech factory where robots and Kwan technicians were working on a massive, complicated looking machine. It was unclear as to what this machine was.
“We were able to hijack some surveillance from one of these factories. As you can see, Kwan technicians have been working feverishly on this, uh, whatever it is.”
Amaga said, “We have reason to believe it is some kind of weapon, Father.”
There was then chatter amongst the people at the table.
Marxis then said, “We also need to remember that the Kwans are aware of what was supposed to be a top secret project known as the Kaoli Man. They became aware as soon as we began investigating these factories.” 
“You’re absolutely right, Marxis,” Amaga said. She then looked everyone over. “We don’t see that as a coincidence. We believe these factories need to be taken out by force.”
Shock and alarm overtook to the table.
Rebekah raised her hand. “Hang on! Why wasn’t I in the loop on this!?”
“Because you’re not the Head Counselor anymore, get over it,” Tiffany said. Robert was hoping this wouldn’t happen.
“Not now, you two,” Father Quelatune said. He turned back to Amaga. “What’s the strategy?”
“Air strike,” she said. “We’ll send our best: the Blue Dragons. There are six factories in all and they’re all working in concert on this machine we are convinced is a weapon. It seems like each factory is working on different parts of the machine. Our analysts are telling us that it might be some type of cannon but we can’t be sure. My brother Smoke and his team were able to hack into the Kwans’ workforce management schedules and we found that their employees have been working overtime.”
Amaga looked at Robert. “Robert, you’re our man.”
Everyone turned to face him.
“What’s going on?” Robert asked.
“What she means is that you are going to embark upon your first mission,” Quelatune said. “You’re the best pilot we’ve got here alongside Amaga. Don’t worry, she’s going to be joining you.”
Amaga gasped and turned to Quelatune. “I am!?”
“That’s right,” he said.
“That wasn’t part of the plan, Father!” Amaga whispered.
“It is now.” 
“What are you, scared?” Rebekah asked, sneering.
“Go to hell,” Amaga responded.
“You’re not helping your cause, Rebekah,” Marxis added.
Rebekah rolled her eyes. “Whatever.”  She turned to Quelatune. “Is my opinion welcome, Father?” 
“Sure,” Quelatune answered, annoyed.
Rebekah stood up. “I just want to say that whatever genius came up with this mission—”
“That was me, Rebekah,” Father Quelatune said.
“Great! Alright then, Father Quelatune, since you’re the genius that came up with this mission, I just want to say that I think it is an absolutely terrible idea.”
“Oh, I wanna hear this,” Amaga said.
“Sit the fuck down,” Rebekah shrieked. Amaga swallowed hard, holding back anger.
“As I was saying, Father,” she continued. “You sending in a rag-tag unit of government officials flying into the outskirts of the Kwan capital city to a group of unknown factories is totally dangerous. You guys will get wiped out. Do you really think they’re not gonna see you guys coming? Keep in mind, Queen Riptide has never lost a major battle ever. They’ve probably got their entire homeland security flying around that place day and night. It’ll be a dogfight. Do you really want a dogfight over this? We don’t even know if what they’re building is dangerous.”
“And just how would you know that, Rebekah?” Marxis asked with suspicion.
“Oh, she’s not a mole at all,” Tiffany added sarcastically.
“I’m not retarded, bitch! That’s how I know,” Rebekah snapped.
“Go on, Rebekah,” Quelatune said.
“Thank you, Father,” she responded. “My proposal is that we try to first find out exactly what it is they’re building before trying to blow it up. It might be nothing. It might be a giant microwave for all we know—”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Amaga butted in. “We’re quite sure it’s a weapon. And might I add, I am your boss now. Secondly, and more importantly, you’re military now, so the chain of command ain’t like it is in your fancy little offices. That is to say that I have the constitutional right not only to fire you but to bitch slap the taste out of your mouth for insubordination, and not even the President of Rulose Island could punish me for it. So know your place.”
“She’s right, Rebekah,” Father Quelatune said. “But we appreciate your input.”
He then got up from his seat. “Today’s meeting is adjourned. We’ll meet up tomorrow. Robert, we’re going to show you around the X2 that you’ll be piloting for this mission by then. You will depart in exactly three days.”
At that, everyone began to leave. Tiffany met up with Robert in the hallway.
“How are you feeling about all of this?” she asked.
Robert was confident in his new abilities. He knew he’d be fine. “Not bad, Tiff. But don’t let Rebekah talk to you the way she has. Remember, she has to answer to you now.”
Tiffany nodded. “Oh, don’t worry about me, Robert. I honestly feel like a completely different woman from what I felt like when I arrived here. I haven’t even thought about leaving.”
“You know we’re gonna have to eventually though, Tiff. You have a son at home.”
Tiffany paused. “Look, that’s a bridge we can cross when we come to it. I have no problem raising my son here.”
“Please tell me you’re kidding.”
“What if I’m not?”
Tiffany walked off, leaving Robert slack-jawed.</Text>

            <Text>The next day, Amaga showed Robert around the X2. It was similar to the X1 he piloted in the Desert of Illusion except this one was even bigger with more guns and a more efficient Shield. The cockpit was also more user friendly and the seats were more comfortable. The radar had a larger screen and was able to track enemies coming from further away and the ship, despite its larger size, had a faster maximum speed. Amaga was also quite ready to state that she had designed this one too.
Amaga showed him a new feature they added that would be of great benefit to him: magic-powered weaponry. A massive cannon was equipped at the top of the ship that would be powered by his magic. There were two additional guns on the sides he could cast spells through as well. There was a compartment on the dash in which Robert would insert his Crystal to gain access to a whole new set of weapons as a result of him channeling his new powers. He couldn’t wait to see what he could conjure up in this baby.</Text>

            <Text>Over the next couple of days, Robert suffered a string of flashbacks which he had rarely suffered from since his arrival. Tiffany was there to help him but he felt bad because she was busy doing her job as Head Counselor yet also having to tend to him. Amaga got worried and started having second thoughts about him embarking on this mission but Tiffany convinced her he would be fine.
Amaga brought him to her office the night before.
“Tell me how you feel, Bob. It’s perfectly human to be nervous before a mission. It’s only ten hours from now we’re going to be flying out to the heart of the Kwan Empire. Are you absolutely sure you’re up for this?”
“I wouldn’t have come here to this planet if I wasn’t,” Robert responded. “With all due respect, I have more experience at this than you do.”
Amaga nodded and smiled.

The next morning they headed out to Castlerock and from there, made the journey to Amelrak. 
Robert sat in the X2 at the co-pilot seat alongside Smoke. At the moment, the ship was on autopilot and they were flying over the ocean. It would be hours before they made it to Amelrak. 
The fleet of Blue Dragons and rebels, the A1, X1 and X2 were all taking different routes. That way, in the event that the Kwans tried to take them out before reaching the city, they would have to split up their forces to do so.</Text>

“Uh oh! Company!” Smoke shouted into a microphone as his voice rang out through loudspeakers. “Everybody, let’s get a move on!”
The crew rushed to their stations. Robert was focused but nothing was coming up on the radar.
“I don’t see anything!” Robert said.
“Wait,” Smoke responded.
The ship then rocked. They were hit. Smoke almost lost control.
“What the hell!?” Smoke cried out.
“We’ve been hit!” Members of the crew were saying.
On the radar, a litany of red dots representing enemy war machines surrounded them. There were at least twenty. Robert panicked. This was way more than what he had to deal with in the Desert of Illusion.
“How did they know we were gonna be here!?” Smoke asked. “They basically sent their entire Air Force!”
They would later find out it wasn’t just their ship that had been ambushed. 
“We’re under attack!” Amaga screamed out from her ship more than 50 miles away over the radio. “They’ve got motherships! Eleven of them! War machines! Nearly a hundred!”
“What!!?” Smoke screamed. “One hundred!? Amaga! Abort! Abort!”
No answer.
“Amaga!!!” Still nothing. Smoke quickly turned his attention back to he and Robert’s current predicament as the enemy war machines surrounded them. “Cut the Shield on, Bob!”
Robert did as he was told and cut the Shield on.
“Time to give these new magic weapons a test!” Robert said.
The large magic-powered cannon aimed at several war machines, locking onto them. He hit the button at the top of his joystick and a firestorm of heat energy blasted from the cannon. It instantly took down two war machines at once.
They heard blasting all around the ship but didn’t feel anything as the Shield was on. The Shield was taking a beating.
“We’re being hit left and right, Bob!” Smoke said. “The Shield is gonna deplete if this keeps up!” 
Robert turned the cannon behind him and fired another blast of Hell. Two more war machines went down in flames.
A massive war machine showed up head on in front of them. This one was much bigger than any war machine Robert has ever seen.
“A Captain’s ship! Look out Robert! They have Shield-penetrating weapons!”
Robert didn’t like the sound of that. Smoke banked up. Robert turned the cannon around, concentrated really hard to get a good shot and cried out, putting all of his magic energy into the blast as he hit the firing button. The X2 jolted hard as the blast fired from the cannon, lighting up the evening sky. The Captain’s ship skillfully dodged all of it, barely, but four war machines went down in flames all at once. Robert was starting to feel tired. He was overusing his magic.
“I’m feeling weak,” Robert said. “That last blast took everything out of me.” 
Robert was starting to feel queasy and dizzy as the fatigue ate at his body. His lips and hands felt numb.
“Robert, use your regular weapons for a while!” Smoke said. 
Two crew members rushed over to him and fed him protein bars, frantically jamming them into his mouth so fast he could barely chew and swallow them.
They then frantically jammed a bottle of thick, creamy, disgusting but ice-cold bender milk down his throat, again, so fast he could barely swallow it, making a mess of milk all over his mouth and shirt. That being said, he quickly began to regain his bearings due to the nourishment.
Another war machine came up from the side, firing at them. Robert couldn’t get a clear shot but their ship was being pounded.
There was then a loud buzzing sound. Robert knew what that meant because Amaga told him what it meant a few days ago. The Shield had depleted.
“There goes the Shield!” a crew member said. 
The war machine took advantage and shot a laser that smacked the X2 so hard one of the engines blew out and the ship itself back-flipped in the air. Every standing crew member on board was instantly thrown from their feet and hit the ground, or was thrown into walls. 
“We lost an engine! Going to auxiliary power!” one of the crew members shouted.
“That was a big hit!” Robert said. “There’s more war machines on our tail! They’ve got reinforcements!”
“How many!?” Smoke asked. 
Robert looked at the radar but the radar was completely dead. Robert’s eyes widened with disbelief. “What!? The radar, it’s—”
Booom! Booom! Booom! The ship shook as they were hit by a firestorm of missiles. It felt like an earthquake inside the X2 as crew members could barely stand.
“Damage level at fifty percent, sir! We’re almost in the danger zone!” a crew member called out. “We’re taking massive damage!” 
The radar was still dead. Perhaps the big hit they took knocked their communications out?
“The radar is not working! What the hell happened to the radar? Is it damaged!?” Smoke asked.
“No, it’s not!” a crew member answered. “We’re currently trying to diagnose what happened to the communications too but nothing seems wrong with either!”
“Marxis! This is Robert from the X2! Can you hear us!?” 
Nothing.
“Marxis!!”
Still nothing.
“…the hell is going on!?”
“No damage to the radar or communications, sir!” another crew member called out.
“Are they jamming it then!?” Robert asked.
“Impossible!” Smoke answered.
Boooom! Booom! Booom! They were getting hit again. 
Robert fired two missiles at two oncoming war machines in front of them. 
Boooom! They both exploded.
“More are coming!” Smoke said. “It’s like a freaking hydra! You kill one head and two more grow back!”
The radar was still dead and they had no communication with Mission Control so they had no idea how many more were out there. 
“The radar!” Smoke cried out in panic. “What’s happened to the radar!? Somebody! Somebody, try to figure this out!!”
Booom! Booom! Booom! They continued to take shots.
“Damage at 80 percent! Danger zone! Abort! Abort!” a crew member cried out.
“Fuck!!” Smoke cursed as he cut on the afterburners.
They jettisoned straight up into the sky.
Boom! Boom! The ship rocked as they took more punishment.
“They’re chasing us!” Robert said.
“Damage at 86 percent!” a crewman cried out. 
It wasn’t long before they were too high in altitude for the war machines to catch them. They were done for but at least there was peace and quiet.
“Amaga!” Smoke cried out to his sister but the communications were dead.
“Amaga!!” he screamed, beating on the dash. No answer on the other end. Robert could tell he was worried sick about her. The last time they heard from her, her ship and crew were surrounded by even worse than what he and Smoke were surrounded with.
“What the hell is going on!?” Smoke asked. “Are you guys sure something wasn’t damaged!?”
“Everything looks normal, Smoke. We swear,” a crewman answered.
Smoke didn’t believe him. He unlatched himself and got up from his seat, setting the X2 into autopilot. Robert got up and followed him. 
Robert followed Smoke out of the cockpit and down the hallway. Crew members at their stations looked with concern as he and Robert walked by them. They went into a small dark room where a woman was working at an advanced computer station. There were monitors and devices all along the walls.
“Hop up, real quick,” Smoke said as he barged in. The woman nervously got up.
Smoke sat down, logged in and started hacking away. Lines of computer code flew across the screen as he typed feverishly. Several minutes passed as he accessed files and went through some kind of instruction manual. He went back to feverishly typing while looking at the manual. Robert and the woman watched, having no idea what Smoke was doing. More minutes passed and then—
“Christ…” Smoke said with disbelief.
Robert and the woman glanced at each other, worried. 
“What is it, Smoke? Robert asked.
Smoke pointed at the screen at an error message that read “ACCESS DENIED. THE DATABASE MAY BE CORRUPT”.
“What the hell?” the woman whispered, awestruck.
“We’ve been hijacked. Again,” Smoke said. “Just like you guys were in the box, Robert. I was trying to get to the communications program to look at it but it was corrupted. So I went to the backup database which can only be downloaded from a secret location which is from a satellite orbiting another planet, but that backup database has been corrupted. That’s the error message your looking at now. 
“That means somebody knew where it was. Only myself, Father Quelatune, Marxis, Amaga and Rebekah know where the Air Force backup database is, what planet and what satellite it’s on. I suppose Tiffany might know now but that’s neither here nor there.”
“Maybe there’s always been something wrong with the backup database,” the woman said. “You guys have never had to access it before. Maybe that database has been corrupt for a long time and you guys are just now finding out.”
“No. We checked the backup database last night to make sure it was working and it was,” Smoke said. “Somebody messed with it as of this morning,”
“But wait,” Robert said. “I thought Amaga said the X1 had anti hijacking equipped. So surely the X2 must have it.”
“It does,” Smoke said. “But the security system’s program was tampered with and corrupted along with the communications program. So again, I went to the backup database to get a backup for the X2 but like I said, the database is corrupted.” 
“So you’re saying that somebody at the Temple deliberately hacked into this plane so Lemor-Ixa could hijack it?” Robert asked.
“That’s exactly what I’m saying,” Smoke said. “Luckily, due to technological limitations, the ship’s controls are completely independent from the ship’s communications unlike the box you guys were in on your way here to this planet. So thank God they couldn’t hijack our controls and throw insults at us through the radio like they could to you guys in the box. But they can shut off our communications and radar, which they did.”
Robert sat down on a small couch, leaned back and sighed. “How did the Kwans even know about this mission?” he asked.
Smoke sat down next to him and said, “We have a mole.”
“Shit…”</Text>

            <Title>Crash on the Ground/Battle</Title>
            <Synopsis>The A1 crashes after a malfunction. The X1 is shot down. The X2 makes an emergency landing. Kwans storm the place. Robert kicks ass.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The last word Amaga heard from her brother was “Abort!”
She had much more military training than he did, but she knew that was what she had to do. As powerful as the A1 was, it was not going to be any match for one-hundred war machines along with eleven motherships. Motherships are the Kwans’ answer to Rulose battle ships like the X1, X2 and A1. Amaga cut on the afterburners to escape, but they suddenly quit working. Her crew frantically tried to find out why but everything seemed to be functioning properly according to their diagnostics. 
“It’s almost like this ship has been tampered with, ma’am!” a crewman said.
The pounding their ship was taking began to put their lives in serious jeopardy.
“89% damage! We’re about to crash!”
“I’m emergency landing this thing!” Amaga said. “Hopefully there’s no hostiles on the ground where we’ll end up, but no promises!”
Amaga put in the emergency landing codes. The ship didn’t respond.
“You gotta be kidding me!” Leoma screamed from the co-pilot seat, anger and fear flashing across her youthful face. “The landing program doesn’t work either! What’s wrong with this ship!?”
“I know exactly what’s wrong,” Amaga said.
A crewman called out, “Diagnostic on landing program complete! Corrupt file!”
“Leoma, I’m gonna have to land this manually!” Amaga said.
Leoma asked, “But how!? We’re taking several shots! We’ll crash before we land!” 
“Look!!” Amaga screamed, pointing at the altitude dropping rapidly. They were now  literally on a crash course. Leoma stared in horror.
“Damage at 93%! All engines lost! Aux power not enough to hold! We’re on a crash course! We’ve been shot down! Shot down! Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!”
Amaga and Leoma unlatched frantically as crew members throughout the large A1 battleship rushed to their emergency evacuation pods, quickly taking parachutes. Amaga and Leoma joined them. 
One by one, each crew member was shot out in different directions from emergency pods into the open sky as their parachutes popped open. The captain’s pod, which was Amaga’s pod was special in that it had a communications device inside. In this particular case, however, it was also special in that it was completely nonfunctional. Amaga’s heart pounded in utter terror. Her eyes darted to and fro to find if there was any loose wiring or something wrong. She found no such thing. She had to think of something because she was stuck inside of a ship on a high-impact crash course.

“We can’t stay up here forever,” Smoke said, getting up from the couch in the X2. They were still coasting in safe altitude. “The others may be in trouble. Our communications and every one of the backup communications are completely dead. We’re gonna have to land. That way we can use our intercoms.”
Robert and Smoke headed back down the hallway and back to the cockpit.
Smoke said, “Brace yourself and get ready to cast your best spells, Bob. We’re gonna be landing in enemy territory.”
They made it back to the cockpit as Smoke and Robert took their seats and latched up.
“Emergency landing sequence initiating!” Smoke called out into the microphone to the crew.
Smoke put in the landing codes and the emergency landing process started. Luckily, they weren’t attacked by any more war machines.
Eventually, the ship landed hard right in the middle of a transport path used to ship goods from one factory to another. Kwan militants probably were on their way to the ship at that very moment.
It wasn’t long before an explosion rocked the back door of the X2. Kwan militants burst inside brandishing heavy rifles. Every crew member scattered frantically like a nest of roaches when the lights come on. The Kwan militants opened fire. Robert went straight into fight mode. He ran into the  panic room and saw Smoke there along with several crew people flooding inside.
“Y’all bring everybody in here. I’m gonna need some room,” Robert said.
The remaining crew members made their way inside the spacious panic room. Robert shut the metal door and padlocked it. It was just him and the Kwans, exactly how he wanted it.
The Kwan militants were no match for him. He tossed a magic grenade at an oncoming onslaught. POW! A wave of fire and magic burned several to a crisp. Kwan militants from two different directions opened automatic fire but Robert waved his hand around him and a shield of glowing heat surrounded him. Each bullet burned to a crisp before reaching him. Robert struck his fist to the ground and the shield quickly expanded into a wave of fire energy that set every Kwan that was firing at him ablaze.
More Kwans ran in and opened machine gun fire. Robert dived behind some boxes and accessed his rifle. As soon as the Kwans ran over to him he peaked over, aimed and fired a torrent of hellfire. Several Kwans dived out of the way but two of them were shot and they ended up going up in flames. Dark smoke clouded the hallway.
One Kwan grabbed him from behind. He was strong, a little stronger and younger than Robert. Robert saw a glint of shiny metal in the Kwan’s hand. He knew it was a knife. Just as the Kwan was about to stab him. Robert kicked the Kwan’s knee out and backhanded him, forcing him to let go. The Kwan advanced on him again but Robert tackled him to the ground and mounted him. Robert placed both of his hands flat on the Kwan’s chest. The Kwan smoked up, convulsing violently and burst into flames. Dead.
Several Kwans surrounded him and opened fire but Robert waved his hand and the shield of heat protected him again. Robert fired. This time it was a massive fireball that he could control. He guided the fireball to strike one Kwan who was firing at him from behind the wall of a hallway, another Kwan who was in front of him, and rest of the Kwans over by the door in the cockpit.
The last Kwan left tossed a grenade but Robert caught it and threw it back but when Robert threw it, it flew like a flaming comet, landing on the ground and exploding with devastating fire and magic. Those Kwans were history.</Text>

            <Title>Battle Plans</Title>
            <Synopsis>Amaga goes over battle plans at their next meeting.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Another meeting in the War Room between mostly the same people took place that evening.  Rebekah, however, was replaced with Smoke. They would be going over the actual plan of attack that would be taking place in two days. Amaga stood in front of a large projector screen with a map of the area in which they would be launching their attack.
“A captain from the Blue Dragons named Leoma will be flying with me in the A1, one of our newest state-of-the-art battle aircrafts,” she said. “It will be seeing only its second combat mission so it’s practically brand new.”
She then pointed to a factory on the northern part of the map. “This is where Leoma and I are going to attack. We go in and take it out. The casualties, we’ll think about later—”
“Hold it,” Robert interrupted. “There may be slaves in there; women, children. Tell me we’re going to make sure they’re gone before we do this.”
“Slaves aren’t working in the factories, Robert,” Marxis said. “They work outdoors, transporting goods and materials. That, or doing menial jobs the Kwans simply don’t want to do. They would never trust slaves to do the kind of work that’s being done in these factories. Our intelligence knows of every slave camp in the Kwan Empire and this isn’t one of them. That is not to say they haven’t ramped up on slave labor because they have, but this mission isn’t going to be anywhere near a slave camp.”
“I see,” Robert said. “Sorry for interrupting, Amaga.”
“It’s alright and thanks for explaining that, Marxis,” Amaga said. She continued. “We believe this factory is their main place of operation for whatever they’re building so we take it out first.” She glanced at Robert. “Robert, you and Smoke are going to be in the X2. Now, Smoke isn’t quite as good a pilot as Cypher was, but we’re dealing mainly with ground resistance so you’re not going to need somebody who can dance around in the air and dodge flying missiles from war machines. We would have given you one of our highly trained pilots but we need them all in the war machines. Anyway, you guys are going to provide us some backup. More than likely, we won’t really need it, but we can’t be too safe. Got it?”
Robert and Smoke glanced at each other and nodded.
“Good.” Amaga then looked over at Father Quelatune.
“Father, I have a surprise for you,” she said with a smile. Father Quelatune sat up.
“Come on in, Cypher!”
The doors to the War Room slid open and in came Cypher. Everyone was surprised and happy to see him. Robert and Tiffany were happy to see him as well.
“Long time no see, brother,” Cypher said as he shook Robert’s hand. He went around and gave hugs and handshakes to everyone including Amaga before making his way over to a seat next to Robert.
“As you can see, Cypher has joined us. In case some of you may not be aware, he is one of the slave rebels fighting the Kwans alongside us. He also piloted the X1 with Robert to fight the Kwans off in the Desert of Illusion on his way here. So we’re glad to have him and the rebels joining us in this mission.”
Amaga went back over to the map and pointed at another factory in the East.
“This factory probably isn’t going to have as much security. Cypher will be piloting the X1 along with a fellow rebel named Armond, a disciple of his. That right, Cypher?”
“You got it,” Cypher said.
“Now, here’s the important thing. They’re gonna go in, not necessarily to take this factory out, but rather, to divert attention away from us attacking the main one in the north. If they’re able to take the factory down, that’s a bonus, but it’s not required.”
Amaga continued with more details of the mission for another twenty minutes, mainly to go over with the generals the plan of attack for the Blue Dragons and rebel fighter pilots who would all be flying war machines to launch attacks on other various targets around the factories and provide support to the three battle ships that would be bombing the factories.
After that, the meeting was adjourned and everyone was dismissed. In two days, they would be heading out to Amelrak early in the morning to launch their attack. The belief was that this was going to be a relatively easy mission.</Text>

            <Title>Retreat</Title>
            <Synopsis>Everyone aborts in the X2 because it's too dangerous. Amaga is dead as is Cypher and Armond.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“All clear!” Robert shouted, exhausted as he dropped to his hands and knees. He looked around. Dark smoke surrounded him as the red embers of the Kwans’ charred bodies glowed.
He went back over to the panic room and opened the door to the awaiting crew. 
“All clear,” he said again, but something wasn’t right. The crew had their heads down solemnly. Smoke was shaking and completely grief-stricken.
“Smoke, what’s going on?” Robert asked.
“M, my sister,” Smoke said, voice breaking, tears welling up in his eyes. Robert knew what he was about to hear but was hoping he wouldn’t. At that point, he felt a wave of despair in the pit of his stomach.
“My sister, she was killed in action. Marxis just called.”
The entire crew remained silent. Robert was mortified. Amaga was so young, such a competent pilot and a gifted designer. Most importantly, she was a sweet, loyal and peace-loving individual. The old feeling of losing a friend in battle suddenly came back to haunt him. He had not felt it since his deployment in Somalia back on Earth when his best friend Randy was killed. The feeling was all too familiar. He knew what Smoke was going through. He saw Tiffany go through it when her husband, and one of his best friends died.
Smoke broke down and cried loudly to the point of nearly screaming. Several crew members grabbed hold of him to try and console him, many of them crying their eyes out as well. Some of them wept even more loudly than he did, especially the women. Amaga had a very close bond with the women in the military. She was the first female Secretary of Defense and was a symbol of empowerment for them. They looked up to her. She was like their big sister. Now she was gone, ripped away from them. 
Robert watched them all, holding onto each other, consoling each other tightly as they cried and wept in that panic room. He felt helpless. He knew there was nothing he could do or say that would make them feel better. He knew there was nothing he could do but be there for them. Smoke, surrounded by those crew members hanging onto him, continued to cry, uttering indistinguishable words through loud sobs, holding onto some kind of small black teddy bear, which made him cry even more each time he looked it. It must have been some kind of memento that meant a lot to him. Robert knew they needed to continue to abort but he let them have their moment.

Robert and his crew were successfully able to abort the mission and land safely back in Castlerock. Once they landed, they found out some more horrible news.
The X1 that was piloted by Cypher and his student, Armond, was shot down. It was shot down by a mothership laser but for some reason, their Shield didn’t work. The X1 exploded in the air, killing everyone on board. Not only was Amaga now dead, but so was Cypher, Armond and the entire crew of rebels on board the X1.
The Blue Dragons’ air strike was arguably the most tragic failure of them all. They were severely outnumbered. Eleven of the nineteen Rulose war machines were shot down by anti-aircraft guns on the ground. Prior to this incident, the largest number of Blue Dragon planes ever shot down in one mission was four. Everyone whose war machines were shot down were tragically killed. Days before their mission, Rulose intelligence found absolutely no anti-aircraft guns anywhere close to the area. That meant the Kwans knew about the mission almost immediately after the first meeting in the War Room and over the next few days, planned accordingly.
This was irrefutable evidence there was a mole in the Rulose Temple.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Robert wakes up in the hospital. Tiffany tells him she's made a fateful decision. She won't tell him what yet.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert woke up in a hospital bed. 
“Not again,” he groaned. 
He looked around. It was quiet. He remembered everything clearly. He was out in the training field and fainted after suffering one of the worst PTSD flashbacks ever. He hasn’t fainted from a flashback in a long time. He then worried that once Father Quelatune got wind of this he would not allow him to serve on the battlefield again. He tried to think positively but he knew that this was a real possibility. He did his best to think up excuses for his flashback: stressful day, magic overuse, fatigue, something. 
At that, the door opened and in came a nice man in a doctor’s coat. 
“Ah, I see that you’re awake,” he said.
“Where am I?” Robert asked.
“You fainted out there in the training field. Tiffany had you sent down here.”
“Where’s ‘here’?”
“Castlerock. Specifically, the Rulose Air Force medical facility. At least one of them anyway.”
“I see. Where’s Tiffany?”
“She actually just left. But you’ll be outta here tomorrow. We just did a full checkup on you and you’re fine. Are you sure you don’t want us to prescribe something for you to deal with the flashbacks?”
“No, that’s OK. I need to keep a clear mind and pills to deal with that is comparable to—”
“Not what we can prescribe you.” 
“I’m fine, thanks.”

In the airship on the way back to Angelina, Tiffany had some news.
“So Robert, I’ve been thinking about something but I’m not sure if I want to break the news yet.”
“Is it big?” Robert asked.
She smiled. “It might be.”
“You getting promoted again?”
“Maybe,” she said, smiling. “Let’s just say that I was offered a pretty great opportunity.”</Text>

            <Text>Finally one night, Tiffany knocked on Robert’s door to pay him a visit. He opened the door and was surprised to find Father Quelatune there with her. They arrived to finally break the news to Robert on what they had been planning.
“Robert, we have finally decided to allow Tiffany to undergo the Kaoli Man operation,” Quelatune said.
Tiffany was smiling and clearly excited. Robert knew this was something she wanted for a long time and was happy for her. He was concerned, however, because if they were wanting her to undergo the operation that would mean she would be serving in combat.
“If you really want to undergo this, I’ll be supportive. You know I will be,” Robert said. “But if they’re having you do this, it will mean you will ultimately be serving in a combat role. You’ve never served in a combat role before.”
Tiffany nodded. “I’m aware of that, Robert. But honestly, I wasn’t meant for a desk job. Don’t get me wrong, being Head Counselor certainly isn’t a boring job. It’s a lot of work. But I want to be where the action is.”
“Amaga was scheduled to undergo the operation after the mission in Amelrak,” Quelatune said.
“But Tiffany’s never had any combat training,” Robert said. “There’s nobody else willing to go through with it?”
“No there isn’t,” Tiffany answered for Quelatune. “Can’t you just be supportive?”
Robert sighed. He didn’t think this made any sense but he nodded. He didn’t really have any other choice. They were merely informing him of what she was going to do. They weren’t asking for his permission.
“I’m just gonna say this, Tiff. Your son already lost his father in combat.”
“I get it, Robert.”
Robert was a little dismayed that she called him Robert, which she never did.
“You know what, Tiff? I’m sorry. I apologize. I should support you,” Robert said.
Tiffany smiled and hugged him. “Thank you, Bob. This really means a lot to me.”</Text>

            <Text>“Feels like the place is spinning,” Tiffany said when she arrived home. Robert was there with her and laughed, partly because he’s experienced all of this himself and knew she would be fine.
“Don’t worry, Tiff. Everything you went through, I went through,” he reassured. “Trust me, it’s worth it.”
Despite Robert’s reassurance, Tiffany did not like being so dependent on him. Robert decided he’d move into Tiffany’s place for a while to take care of her. Because she was so dizzy and weak all the time, he cooked for her and also did chores for her as well. Because she was Head Counselor, her staff took on more of the work for her in the office and even Father Quelatune took on some of her work as well. Everyone chipped in and helped and it drove Tiffany crazy. She hated being a burden on people and couldn’t stand the thought of people having to go out of their way to accommodate for her.
One night, she broke down. “I know it gets better and it’s only been four days, but seeing everyone work longer hours because of this really upsets me,” she lamented.
“Tiff, you did the same thing for me when I was going through my recovery. We want to help you. We’re happy to do it,” Robert said.</Text>

            <Title>Sleep disturbances</Title>
            <Synopsis>She undergoes a sleep study and she has sleep disturbances. This isn't something Robert experienced. The pills helped him sleep. Tiffany, a physician, is unsure of her health.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Like Robert, Tiffany would have to report for medical checkups every day that would last four hours. She hated them just as much as Robert did if not even more because she herself was a physician and did not feel like some of the checkups were necessary.
She would also have to report to the sleep study room at bedtime. Like Robert, she was given her medication to take and the lights would go out. Unlike Robert, however, she didn’t sleep very well in the sleep study at all. She constantly woke up and could not go back to sleep, feeling wound up despite one of the side effects of the medication being severe drowsiness. Robert remembered feeling tired all the time but Tiffany became increasingly more and more wound up before crashing in a two hour light sleep and then waking up wound up again. They gave her sleeping pills which were somewhat helpful. Being the physician that she was, Tiffany was curious as to why the medication was having such a different effect on her sleep patterns compared to Robert.</Text>

            <Title>Higher blood pressure</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany's blood pressure was higher than normal although she was feeling somewhat better. Robert's blood pressure lowered during his recovery.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Two weeks later, Tiffany’s dizziness had subsided and she was beginning to feel better. Interestingly enough, Robert’s dizziness and weakness didn’t really start to subside until midway through week four, so she was actually ahead of schedule in that regard. However, something else was concerning. Her blood pressure had increased. It was possible that stress from overwork (she was still working full time as Head Counselor) was a contributing factor to that along with her sleep difficulties. The medication she was taking lowered Robert’s blood pressure. Father Quelatune ordered that she take time off completely and just focus on her recovery.
“You’re trying to do too much and the docs want you to just relax. You’re having difficulty sleeping and your blood pressure is elevated. They believe you’re overworking yourself while trying to recover from a major operation. Slow down,” Quelatune told her.</Text>

            <Title>Weight loss</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany's dizziness was getting better but her body was weaker and tireder. She was losing weight too. She barely ate. This didn't happen to Robert. She never vomited either. Her voice is weak too. They upped the dosage of her pills by 150%.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After three weeks, Tiffany felt weaker, not stronger. This was particularly concerning because she was supposed to be making progress. Robert also noticed that she was losing weight and didn’t have an appetite. Robert also noticed that she wasn’t vomiting the way he did. Perhaps it might have been because she hardly ever ate. The doctors insisted that she eat more. Robert realized that he needed to help Tiffany by putting his foot down. She did not seem to be as responsible in taking care of herself as he was in taking care of himself and it was slowing down her recovery.
“You need to eat something, Tiff. You’re not going to get any stronger if you don’t. I want you eating four meals a day, you understand?” he insisted.
“Okay, Dad,” Tiffany said as she drug herself out of bed. Her voice had become more faint and weaker too.
Robert cooked for her her favorite stew and she forced it down but only ate about half of it. It was a start at least.
Over the next week, Robert did the best he could to get her to eat but she just simply wasn’t doing it. He wondered what might have been going on. The medical checkups they were having her undergo were extensive. They upped the dosage of her medication by 150%, thinking that would speed up her recovery.</Text>

            <Title>Brain swelling</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany started to feel neck stiffness and blurred vision. Her memory starts fading. Her brain has swollen as well. Robert is getting worried. She was getting worse! They upped the dosage of her meds to 200%.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Robert thought some fresh air would get Tiffany to become more serious about her recovery as she was still just as weak as she was five weeks ago. 
They went to their favorite souvenir shop but Tiffany forgot the person’s name who worked there, despite the two of them being friends. 
“It’s Myra, Tiff,” the woman said, feeling insulted.
Tiffany and Robert headed in a shuttle home. She had not eaten anything all day other than a small bit of the stew Robert cooked for her. Once they got home, Tiffany sat on the couch, leaned back and sighed. 
“What’s up?” Robert asked.
Tiffany picked up the remote and shook her head. “Can you show me how to work this thing again?”
Robert was taken aback. Tiffany watched television all the time and they figured out a long time ago how to work the TV’s on this planet. 
She started mashing the “REQUEST” button repeatedly. “What exactly am I supposed to do with this, again? I can’t remember.”
Robert’s stomach started turning backflips. He was hoping what he was seeing wasn’t what he feared it was. He sighed and went over to her, showing her how to work the remote.
“You hold it down and then call out your request,” he said.
“Oh yeah. Thanks,” she said.
“You want something to eat?” Robert asked.
“I’m not hungry,” she said.
This was gonna be a long night.

The next morning, Robert walked into the living room and saw that Tiffany was not there. He checked her bedroom and saw that she was gone. She must have still been asleep at the sleep study.
The television popped on and it was Rebekah.
“Rebekah?” Robert asked. “Can I help you?”
“Tiffany is still asleep. She is here at the medical facility but we need you to come by.”
“Is everything OK?”
“We don’t know.”
Worried sick, Robert made his way up the elevator to the medical facility.
“Is Tiffany losing her memory?” Rebekah asked.
Robert answered. “Yes she is. I noticed it yesterday. It was pretty sudden.”
One of the physicians walked into Rebekah’s office to join them. He had a Manila envelope in his hand and laid it on the desk in front of Robert. Robert opened the Manila envelop and saw MRI scans.
The doctor said, “We noticed that there is somewhat of a swelling in Tiffany’s brain. She’s still asleep because she went to bed late. She went to bed late because she was complaining about severe neck stiffness.”
Robert was beginning to become worried. This was no longer anything like his recovery. His MRI’s always looked normal and he never suffered from memory loss.
“Be honest with me, doctor,” Robert said. “Is Tiffany gonna be OK?”
“We don’t know for sure what’s going on, Robert,” Rebekah said. “We’re doing the exact same thing with her that we did with you.”
“It doesn’t seem like she’s responding to the medications the way you did. That’s the problem,” the doctor said. “We’ve upped the dosage to double what it was you were taking.”
“Maybe that’s the problem,” Robert said. “Maybe you guys are overdosing her.”
“That’s not it,” the doctor said. “Her nervous system wouldn’t be reacting that way if we were overdosing her.”</Text>

            <Title>Severe insomnia</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany's speech was slurred. Her memory severely messed up. She slept as little as two hours every night. Under constant care. They upped the dosage by 300%.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Over the next couple of days, Tiffany’s vision started to become impaired. She complained of blurry vision. It was at that moment, that Tiffany began to worry herself. Her memory was even worse too. It was one night in the sleep study room before bedtime where she asked in a weak voice, “Am I gonna die, Bob?”
Robert held her close as the medical assistant hooked her up to several monitoring devices. He had no idea how to answer the question but to lie to her and tell her he was sure she’d make it through. He couldn’t be more uncertain though. 
Tiffany was no stronger than she was since her operation despite the fact that they had upped her dosage of medication to three times what Robert took. She had lost a severe amount of weight. Her memory was getting worse. She still had no appetite and to top it all off, she was getting on average, an hour of sleep per night. She would fall into sleep-like stupors but they would not be restful REM sleep, making strange noises during her sleep. Something was seriously wrong and Robert felt helpless as he watched her physically deteriorate. 
She was no longer reporting back home but was under constant care at the medical facility. Things had gotten that serious. Robert spent his entire days there and only went home to go to bed. It was not lost on anyone anymore that Tiffany was not OK.</Text>

            <Title>Stroke</Title>
            <Synopsis>Tiffany started suffering from grand mal seizures and had to be  sedated into sleep. The next night, she suffered from a stroke.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tiffany was so weak and had lost so much weight she was bedridden most of the day. Robert went to get her some lunch but before she could eat it, she suffered from a Grand Mal seizure.
Doctors rushed into to help her and dismissed Robert from the room she was in. Robert and Rebekah sat outside in the waiting room, both nervous and shaken. Tiffany awakened eventually. Robert was surprised when Rebekah told him that wasn’t her first seizure and that she had been suffering from seizures for the past two days.
“We didn’t want to tell you because we didn’t want you to worry. We thought they’d just pass but they started becoming more frequent. I’m really sorry you had to find out this way,” she said.
Robert understood but a thought lingered in his mind, one that he did not want to come to grips with: that she was dying. Even worse, Tiffany herself suspect the same thing. Before going to bed, she asked that night in a weak voice, “Robert, if there’s anything you can do for me right now, it is that you can tell my family that I love them. Please find a way you can make that happen for me.”
Robert wasn’t willing to accept what he knew was a real possibility. “Don’t say that, Tiff. You’re not gonna die. We’re gonna make it through this, OK?”
But reality would hit him and everyone else harder than it had hit them since the start of Tiffany’s operation. In the middle of the night, Tiffany suffered from a massive stroke.

Robert was asleep and there was a knock on his door. He awakened, went over and answered. Rebekah, her makeup-free face wrought with panic, said, “Bob! It’s Tiffany! She’s suffered from a stroke!”
On high alert, he and Rebekah rushed to the elevator and went up two floors to where Tiffany was staying. Rebekah had Robert sit in the waiting room. About 30 minutes later, Rebekah and a neurologist came out to visit with him. They led him to Rebekah’s office, sat him down and gave him the grim news.
The neurologist said, “We know what’s happening to your friend, Robert, and unfortunately, I have to say it’s not good.”
Robert said nothing. He couldn’t. He was literally frozen with fear.
“We discovered that the medication that is designed to prevent the nervous system from shutting down, she isn’t responding to it.”
“What are you saying, doctor?” Robert asked, already knowing the answer to the question.
The doctor looked at Rebekah, as if seeking her permission before continuing. 
Rebekah then said, “Robert, we have a confession to make.”
“What the hell is going on?” Robert asked.
“Before you were brought here, the Kaoli Man was attempted on a little over three hundred soldiers.”
“Yeah? OK.”
“Unfortunately, every one of them were killed.”
Robert’s jaw dropped in disbelief. “My God.”
“Scientists and doctors were able to find out the reason they all died. It turned out that when life energy is extracted from the body, a genetic mutation found in mammals causes their nervous systems to shut down. That is what happened to every one of the individuals who were killed the first time we tried this.”
It was becoming more and more clear why Father Quelatune had someone from Earth undergo this operation.
The doctor then said, “We were able to devise an oral medication that would prevent the shutdown of the nervous system due to the genetic mutation. We animal tested the medication hundreds of times, even on primates, and not a single time did their nervous systems shut down when given the medication. Finally, the medication was successful on you so we were supremely confident that it would be successful on Tiffany, but for some reason it hasn’t been and we have no clue as to why.”
“So she’s dying?” Robert asked.
Rebekah bowed her head, as did the doctor. 
That was all the confirmation Robert needed. He walked out. He couldn’t be there anymore. He knew that Tiffany was on borrowed time. He went down the elevator, locked himself up in his room and cried. He not only felt lied to, but he felt like this somehow must have been the incompetence of the Rulose medical staff. He wanted to indict them all and sue them for malpractice, but he knew nothing like that could ever happen. Nobody even knew about the Kaoli Man operation after all except for the government and apparently now the Kwans. 
It was finally clear to him why Father Quelatune really went all the way to Earth to bring him to this planet. He knew that because the Kaoli Man operation killed over three hundred soldiers, that the public would never allow it again. He imagined how colossal the political damage must have been when he had to report that three hundred families lost their loved ones due to a government experiment he orchestrated. Of course he’d bring someone from Earth, so that just in case the experiment failed again, no one from Rulose Island would have suffered! It all made sense to him now! This had nothing to do with Rulose folk culture and everything to do with politics! He couldn’t trust anyone anymore!
Robert wished he could confront Father Quelatune but Father Quelatune was not in the Temple. He was actually in Castlerock conducting meetings and investigations on the incidents behind the mission failure that killed Amaga, Cypher and Armond. He would be gone for about two weeks. The more he thought about it, however, the less mad he was at Father Quelatune. He understood why Quelatune didn’t want to tell him this. He didn’t want to worry him. He also understood why Father Quelatune forbid Tiffany from undergoing the operation because there was still a slight chance that a life could be lost. He remembered that Amaga was to undergo the operation next but Tiffany insisted that she do it after Amaga passed.
Robert was later able to confirm himself that Tiffany was indeed dying. She had slipped into a coma and the doctor told him that it was only a matter of time. Robert sat by her bedside as she laid there unconscious. He stared at her lifeless form, not knowing if she could hear him or not, but he took her limp, soft hand and his and spoke anyway.
“Tiffany, I just want to say that I am so deeply sorry that I got you wrapped up in all of this. I also want to tell you that if it weren’t for you, your strength, your guidance and most of all your love, I would have never been able to pick myself up again after I lost my wife. I promise that I will take care of your son and do the best I can to take care of your family too. 
“I know it may not feel sometimes that there are people out there who love you, but Tiffany, I want you to know that I love you more than you’ll ever know. I want you to know that so many others out there love you more than you’ll ever know. I want you to know that my life is never gonna be the same again, knowing that you’re no longer gonna be by my side. 
“But Tiffany, you’re on your way to a better place; a place where there’s no suffering, a place where people like you go after they live in this miserable universe never to have to endure the pain that I feel right now ever again. If there’s anybody who didn’t deserve this, it was you. What I would give to trade places with you right now! If there was anything I could do that would save your life, I would do it, even if that meant giving up my own life. I would gladly do it and nobody could stop me.
“I know that when I get back home to Earth, the whole world is gonna blame me for what happened to you here. That is a responsibility I am willing to take up. I am willing to shoulder a lifetime of shame if it meant even one minute of your life being honored and respected. You’re one of the bravest, smartest and most beautiful people I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know. Thank you for everything.”</Text>
